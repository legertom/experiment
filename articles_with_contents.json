Add-ons\n9. Who should sign up for Clever?\n\n \n\n\nGetting started with Clever? Check out our course Clever Academy for District Admin, Level 1, available in Clever Academy!\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever automates the secure transfer of student rosters to authorized parties. This enables continuously updated roster\ninformation in learning programs. Clever also offers single sign-on access for students and teachers via the Clever\nPortal. Clever's core features are free for schools and districts in the United States and Canada! This means Clever doesn’t\ncharge schools or districts to utilize our platform. For more information about Clever's pricing, please visit: How much does\nClever cost districts and schools?\n\nClever replaces outdated systems that take away from learning time. Manual, vendor-speciﬁc processes, such as emailed CSV ﬁles or\nvendor-speciﬁc bulk transfers, are often insecure, inconvenient, or both. Clever is engineered to be the most secure and\nconvenient way for districts to send vendors data. Additionally, Clever offers Single sign-on (SSO) which grants students and\nteachers access to all of their learning applications with a single set of credentials through the Clever Portal.\n\n \n\nPlease note: If you are outside of the United States, check out our international article for more information. \n\n \n\nAccessibility\nWe understand how important it is for all users to be able to easily use the Clever platform. To ensure that we are meeting the\naccessibility standards of all students and families, we undergo a voluntary audit every year and update the platform based on the\nlatest guidelines. Please reach out to our support team if you would like more information. You can review our full accessibility\nstatement here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSECURE SYNC\n\n * Secure Sync maintains up-to-date roster information in your learning applications by securely transferring your roster uploads\n   or connecting directly with your Student Information System (SIS) to provision student, teacher, and admin accounts.\n * Data is shared with applications based on sharing rules that you set in your Clever Dashboard - keeping the control in your\n   hands. Learning applications regularly update any changes to your enrollment information in Clever. Learn more about Secure\n   Sync here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO)\n\n * Single sign-on (SSO) allows students and teachers to use a single set of credentials to sign in to all of their learning\n   applications.\n * Clever integrates with your existing identity provider (Google, ADFS, and more) or accepts your own synced credentials to make\n   this possible. Learn more about Single sign-on (SSO) here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER PORTAL\n\n * As part of Single sign-on (SSO), each student and teacher has access to a free personalized portal with every learning\n   application they use.\n * Through the Clever Portal, students and teachers can access all their learning programs with a single set of\n   credentials. Students spend time learning—not searching for applications or remembering passwords.\n * Students and teachers can access their learning programs through the Clever Portal in 3 easy steps:\n   * Navigate to your district’s custom unique Portal URL (i.e. Clever login page)\n   * Type in their credentials, or log in using a Clever Badge\n   * Be signed into their connected apps via single sign-on through Clever!\n\n For more information on using the Clever Portal, visit: Clever Portal: Overview & Management.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER LIBRARY\n\n * Clever Library is a place for teachers to discover, learn about, and adopt new resources for their classroom. Resources in the\n   Library can be added to a teacher’s Teacher Page for easy access by students and teachers. You can read more about Clever\n   Library here. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER MESSAGES\n\n * With Messages, teachers can communicate with students directly from the Clever Portal! Messages can be turned on or off at any\n   time. To find out more about Clever Messages, read here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER ANALYTICS\n\n * As a Clever Admin, keep your finger on the pulse of students and teacher engagement with edtech programs. You can view the data\n   as charts in Clever, or export the data as CSVs or even send them to your data warehouse via SFTP. Learn more here.\n * We didn't forget teachers, either! They have access to Class Analytics to view engagement data for their students.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADD-ONS\n\n * In addition to our free core features, we offer some paid add-ons based on requests from districts. \n   * Identity Management (IDM): we offer IDM for Google and/or Active Directory.\n   * App Store: shop for new edtech programs and for Clever-exclusive bundles right in Clever, via the App Store.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nWHO SHOULD SIGN UP FOR CLEVER?\n\n * Clever is optimized to be managed at the district level. In order to create and administer a Clever account, you will need\n   administrative access to your SIS and the authority to sign Clever’s Terms of Service.\n   * Examples of individuals with sufficient access to manage a Clever account include Chief Technology Officers, SIS/Database\n     Managers, and other district IT Administrators. Teachers, Academic Coaches, and Principals typically have insufficient SIS\n     access to set up a Clever account.\n\nIf you're ready to sign up, please go here: clever.com/district-signup. We're looking forward to working with you!"

You can add this as an optional, paid add-on. \n * Clever Admins can shop for new edtech programs and for Clever-exclusive bundles right in Clever in the App Store.\n\n\n\nHOW DOES CLEVER GENERATE REVENUE?\n\nClever's partnerships with online learning providers (i.e. application partners) are what generate revenue for us. Our application\npartners pay Clever based on their usage of our Application Programming Interface (API). Essentially, they purchase Clever’s\ntechnology, including complex integrations with various Student Information Systems (SIS). This allows our partners to focus on\ntheir core business needs instead of dedicating time to complicated district setups. With a Clever integration, application\npartners avoid building and maintaining custom integrations for every district—freeing up resources and streamlining operations.\n\n For more information regarding application partner pricing, please visit our pricing page here.\n\nRelated articles:\n * Clever's Business Model"

Clever IDM\n\n \n\n\nCLEVER’S DIGITAL LEARNING PLATFORM\n\nClever’s digital learning platform, which 70% of US K-12 districts use to connect to their digital learning resources, is and\nalways will be free for districts in the United States and Canada.  The free digital learning platform includes rostering, single\nsign-on, the Clever Portal, Analytics, and now Messaging for teachers, students, and parents, all in one place.\nWe believe that technology has the ability to empower teachers, create new ways to learn, and improve education outcomes for all\nstudents.  And we believe everyone - all students -  should be able to access EdTech quickly and securely.\n\nOur innovative business model is why we can offer Clever’s digital learning platform to districts for free.  We’re grateful to\napplication partners who use and pay Clever for secure, automated rostering so that educators and students can seamlessly log in\nto their digital learning resources for free.  We also work with our application partners to ensure their pricing is not higher\nfor districts that use Clever.\n\nWe continue to provide world-class training and support at no cost.  This includes self-paced, on-demand training for district\nadministrators, school tech leads, and teachers on how to get started with Clever. Plus, find documentation customized for your\nrole in our help center, or open a ticket with our dedicated support team.\n\nClever gives educators transparency, visibility, and control over data sharing.

External Links\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever supports several types of district learning applications. This article outlines the differences between each type of\napplication. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMost district applications are added by district admins to Clever via the Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add\nApplications page. From this page, applications can be sorted by integration type to make it easier to locate the right one for\nyour district.\n\n\n\nClever is available at no cost to schools and districts - they do not pay Clever to utilize our platform. However, some learning\napplications do require certain fees to use their products through Clever (e.g. licensing or subscription fees). The 'Request\nApplications' list can also be sorted by 'Free' which provides a list of learning applications that are completely free to\ndistricts.\n \n\n For more information, please visit: How do I add or remove a district application?\n\n \n\n\nThe following application types can only be added by a Clever Admin: \n\n * Rostering\n * Single Sign-on (SSO)\n * Rostering & Single Sign-on (SSO)\n * SSO (SAML)\n * SSO (Saved Passwords)\n   \n   \n\nThe following application types can only be added to Clever by a teacher:\n\n * Library\n   Clever Admins can recommend library apps. Learn more.\n\n \n\nOnce an application is launched or requested, you can find out what the application type is on the Clever Dashboard home page\nunder \"App Type.\" \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nROSTERING APPS\n\nRostering applications support Secure Sync Rostering. This means the rostering data from your district's student information\nsystem (SIS) is synced to Clever, which is then synced to your connected rostering applications. Up-to-date rostering data is\nmaintained in your connected learning applications by the secure transfer of your SIS data from Clever to the applications.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) APPS\n\nThese applications are integrated with Clever and support single sign-on (SSO). These applications do not receive rostering data\nfrom Clever.\n\n \n \n\nIn addition to traditional SSO apps, we also offer SSO (SAML) apps.\n\nThese apps are integrated with Clever for Single Sign-On (SSO) but require additional setup in order to authenticate users. Most\nSSO (SAML) applications have documentation available from Clever or the application partner to guide the setup process. SSO (SAML)\napplications do not provide applications access to rostering data.\n\nIf interested in rostering for the application, please search for the app partner's \"Rostering\" application if available, as some\nSSO (SAML) apps offer both SSO and Rostering. If offered they are two separate apps you must add to Clever.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nROSTERING AND SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) APPS\n\nThese applications support both rostering and SSO! This means all rostering and single sign-on data is synced to the application\nby Clever.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLIBRARY APPS\n\nThe Clever Library is a place for teachers to discover, add, and review new resources for their classrooms. Resources in the\nLibrary can be added by teachers to their Teacher Pages for easy access by students. \n\nLibrary apps provide lightweight rostering and are able to create accounts for students/teachers! They are the easiest and most\nsecure way for teachers to add applications for their classrooms and provide a seamless SSO experience.\n\nDistrict administrators have the ability to recommend and block Library resources, or disable the Library feature completely for\ntheir district. Information on managing the Library at the district-level can be found here.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSSO (SAVED PASSWORDS) APPS\n\nSSO (Saved Passwords) applications are apps that don't currently have a rostering or single sign-on (SSO) integration with Clever,\nbut can still be accessed via SSO through the Clever Portal. This means districts can provide users with a seamless SSO experience\nfor almost any learning application even if it is not an existing Clever partner. \n\nWith the SSO (Saved Passwords) option, rostering data and user accounts are not synced to the app by Clever. This means they must\nbe created within the application in advance, and user login credentials need to be manually set by the district admin, or by the\nusers themselves. Clever will securely store these credentials so district users are logged into the applications automatically\nvia single sign-on through Clever. \n\nClick here to read more about SSO (Saved Passwords) applications.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nEXTERNAL LINKS\n\nCustom external links work much like bookmarks by bringing district users directly to the application's login page where they can\nenter their credentials for that application. These types of applications are not integrated with Clever.\nClick here to read more about how to add custom external links.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any questions about the types of learning applications in Clever, please reach out to Clever Support! We are happy to\nhelp!"

Student Data Privacy at Clever\n4. Infrastructure\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSchool districts across the nation rely on Clever to sync roster data with their applications, in part because security is a top\npriority. Clever keeps student information safe by ensuring:\n \n\n * Full district control over data access rights at all times;\n * A robust privacy policy that governs our use of student data; and\n * Protection through a tested and secure infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFULL DISTRICT CONTROL\n\nDistricts control data access at all points in the process, from signup all the way through account provisioning. Districts\ndetermine:\n \n\n * What data Clever can access (always read-only);\n * How often they sync data with Clever;\n * Which applications can access data; and\n * How much data each application can access (via data sharing permissions).\n\nDistricts can fine-tune these settings at any time through the Clever Dashboard. If a district chooses to discontinue their Clever\nsync, they can do so at any time. Clever will delete their account and remove any residual data immediately upon request.\n\n\n\nSTUDENT DATA PRIVACY AT CLEVER\n\nClever syncs basic information to manage user accounts in online learning applications, such as student and teacher identifiers,\nsection names, and enrollment information.\n \n\nAll rostering data that is synced with Clever is protected by industry-leading infrastructure (see below). Clever will never use\nor sell student information for marketing or other purposes.\n \n\nAdditionally, Clever maintains FERPA compliance under the FTC's School Officials Exemption, meaning Clever provides a service on\nbehalf of schools that the schools themselves would usually provide. Furthermore, all Clever-supported applications agree to\nadhere to FERPA requirements in the terms of our partnership.\n \n\nTo learn more about data privacy, you can read Clever's full Privacy Policy\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nClever has spent years developing one of the best security infrastructures in K-12 education. Key features of Clever's\nindustry-leading infrastructure are:\n \n\n * AES256 data encryption for data at rest;\n * TLS with strong ciphers, with a preference for those with perfect-forward secrecy, for data in transit;\n * Multiple factor authentication;\n * Third-party security audits and code reviews;\n * Responsible disclosure (“bug bounty”) program;\n * Full-time security administrator; and\n * Employee background checks.\n\nThe syncing process is encrypted at all times using 256-bit encryption, which is double the standard used by the consumer banking\nindustry. In addition, Clever's production environment is completely isolated from the internet, and all access is logged and\nsecured using multiple factor authentication.\n \n\nClever has a full-time security administrator and invests in regular third-party audits in order to ensure continual improvement\nof security protocols.\n \n\n If you’re interested in learning more, please read more about our comprehensive security program."

We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCybersecurity continues to be a key issue for districts as more malicious actors target school districts and exploit\nvulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure. This article discusses some key cybersecurity best practices when managing your Clever\naccount. \n\nOf course, please always consult the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency’s website and their report on cybersecurity.\nUse this article for general cybersecurity reminders regarding your management of Clever, Clever users, and Clever integrations.\n \n\n\nIf you'd like more in-depth support on district cybersecurity, check out Quick start - District cybersecurity in Clever Academy.\nWe also have teacher training, Quick start - Cybersecurity basics for teachers.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCYBERSECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR DISTRICT\n\nWe recommend you review these recommendations at least once a semester to make your schools as secure as possible.\n \n\n\nKEEPING YOUR CLEVER ADMIN ACCOUNTS SECURE\n\nIMPORTANT \nGiven the unique permissions Clever Admin accounts have, we recommend carefully reviewing these recommendations whenever a new\nClever Admin needs to be added or removed from your district.\n\n * All Clever Admin accounts should have strong, unique passwords that are not reused on any other service. Clever Admin can reset\n   their password here by following the instructions here.\n\n \n\n * The Clever Admin Owner of your district should be assigned to the appropriate staff member. This admin user role has special\n   privileges, including deleting all your data from Clever!\n\n \n\n * All Clever Admin should have Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) turned on.\n   * If Clever Admins use an Identity Provider (IDP) such as Google to access their accounts, ensure they have MFA turned on for\n     access to the IDP.\n\n \n\n * Review and remove any administrative accounts that are no longer in use here.\n\n\n\nPROTECTING STUDENT, TEACHER, AND STAFF ACCOUNTS\n\n * Certain district logins, like Active Directory and Google, also act as IDPs, granting access to additional resources (like\n   Clever). Ensure students, teachers, and staff use strong, unique passwords to access their IDP accounts. See Clever IDM for\n   ways to ensure that your IDP accounts are always up-to-date and secure.\n\n \n\n * Review Clever and other program access for anyone no longer in the district or performing a specific role and remove access for\n   anyone no longer in the district.\n   * We recommend that you implement automated account provisioning for your district identity accounts so accounts are managed\n     quickly (so, for instance, staff members who have left your school or district no longer have access to their email\n     accounts). See Clever IDM for more information about automated account provisioning for Google, Active Directory, and Entra\n     ID.\n\n * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for teachers and staff to protect access to sensitive services across your\n   organization. \n\n \n\n * Verify login logs regularly (you can see all logins for the past 14 days) to look for any unusual activity (such as suspicious\n   IP addresses).\n\n\n\nKEEPING YOUR SYNC SAFE\n\n * Ensure that all administrative logins to your SIS, including automated service logins (such as for Clever-managed Auto-Sync ),\n   use strong, unique passwords.\n\n \n\n * If your district uses SFTP to sync data to Clever, and you believe your SFTP password was compromised, please reach out to\n   Clever Support to reset them immediately by clicking Contact Us and answering the prompts.\n\n\n\nPROTECTING OTHER APPLICATIONS\n\n * Adding your district’s apps to Clever is a more secure way of offering access to users vs. a username and password for each\n   app. Likewise, we recommend you regularly review any apps that are not on Clever and add them if an SSO and/or rostering\n   integration is available.\n\n \n\n * Periodically review apps you’ve added to Clever to ensure you’re sharing data responsibly:\n   * Review the apps you’ve connected to in Clever, along with the data you’re sharing with them.\n   * If your schools no longer use any apps, consider disconnecting them from Clever so you’re not sharing data unnecessarily \n   * For apps your schools are still using, check your sharing rules to see if you’re sharing data that no longer needs to be\n     shared. For instance, if you were using an app with grades 6-8 last year, but this year it’s only being used by 6th graders,\n     you should update the sharing settings, so only 6th-grade data is being shared.\n\n \nLastly, if you notice anything suspicious with your Clever account, please get in touch with Clever Support immediately by\nclicking Contact Us and answering the prompts."

    "content": "ANNOUNCING API V3.0\n\nClever’s newest API version simplifies data management for partners and districts. The next generation API offers a new flexible\ndata model to help partners meet the fast-evolving and unique needs of their district customers in a scalable way.\n\nAPI v3.0 will include the following features:\n \n\n\nSUPPORT FOR MULTI-ROLE USERS\n\nIn v1.0 and v2.0, users with multiple roles had a Clever ID for each role. This could often be confusing in downstream\napplications where users might have duplicate accounts or would struggle to access the correct account. Moving forward, API v3.0\nwill provide flexible user-role data to streamline the experience of provisioning teachers, staff, and contacts so applications\ncan easily scale access for all users on their platform. If a user has multiple leadership roles (at the district, school, or\nteacher level), they will now have a single Clever ID.\n \n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS?\n\nThis updated data model will not be very noticeable in the Clever Dashboard or Portal. Users with multiple roles will still have\nseparate Portals in Clever. However, downstream applications will now have the ability to identify users with multiple roles and\nlink those accounts accordingly. Some applications will also have the ability to allow users to toggle between accounts. \n \n\n\nCONTACTS HAVE PER-STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS\n\nTo make it easier for partners to support and connect with family members, we’re adding even more granularity to our contact\nrelationships. If a contact is a parent to two children, also has a nephew in the district, and is an emergency contact for a\nfamily friend, they’ll have one Clever ID and you’ll be able to see those unique relationships with every single student. \n \n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS?\n\nContact data will now be more accurate and relationship types will be much less rigid. This update recognizes the complexity of\nthe different types of relationships individuals may have as contacts for students. This change will address the security risks of\nassigning only one relationship type to a contact who may otherwise have other relationship types with other students. \n \n\n\nCHANGES TO STAFF\n\nAPI v3.0 will support a consistent experience for how districts and applications refer to Staff (formerly referred to as ‘School\nAdmins’).\n\nFurthermore, role types for Staff will now be available through the API, making it easy to distinguish between the different\nlevels of permissions Staff have in Clever (e.g. School Tech Lead vs. Portal-Only).\n \n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS?\n\nThis update will serve to bring more alignment to how our school district and application partners communicate about staff users.\nBy updating the way we refer to this user type in the API, we hope to close the loop on some of the miscommunication that occurs\nwhen rostering staff users. \n\nIn addition, exposing the staff role field in the Clever API will give application partners more flexibility in provisioning\naccount permissions.\n \n\n\nCONTENT ASSIGNMENT\n\nSome applications allow you to map resources to specific courses, classes, or users. This often requires district administrators\nto work with each application directly to manually assign these resources. To address this pain-point, we’ve created a feature\nthat helps you manage content mapping directly from your Clever dashboard! \n\nTo learn more about content assignment, check out this article: For District Admins: Content Mapping\n \n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen can we expect to see these changes?\n\n * It is up to each application when they will choose to adopt the new API version. Even for our early adopters, it will take some\n   time to implement these changes and migrate their data over. If you would like to know more about how an application will be\n   utilizing our new API, we recommend reaching out to them directly.\n\n\nHow will I know what version of the API the application is on?\n * You can always feel free to reach out to Clever support for more information about the API version an application is using.\n   However, how each application chooses to use v3.0 will be up to them. Clever does not guarantee any specific user experience\n   changes as a result of this new API version release. If you have more specific questions, we recommend reaching out to the\n   application directly."

Clever’s services follow privacy principles and data\nsecurity standards that can help schools comply with regulations applicable to Canadian schools. \nIn order to meet the needs of Canadian schools, Clever has:\n\n * Updated its Terms of Use\n * Updated its privacy notice for Canada-specific regulatory requirements\n * Created a Canadian Data Processing Addendum\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER’S COMPLIANCE WITH CANADIAN PRIVACY LAWS \n\nClever adheres to internationally recognized privacy principles. Clever understands that Canadian schools are subject to specific\nCanadian privacy laws. With Clever’s services, public schools can comply with provincial Freedom of Information and Protection of\nPrivacy legislation and private schools can comply with private sector personal information protection laws such as the British\nColumbia Personal Information Protection Act, the Alberta Personal Information Protection Act and the Quebec Act respecting the\nprotection of personal information in the private sector. \n\nClever is also a proud signatory of the Student Data Privacy Pledge, the first recipient of the IMS TrustEd Apps Seal, and has\nreceived CommonSense Privacy Program’s highest possible rating, Use Responsibly, based on a full privacy evaluation.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSCHOOLS ARE IN CONTROL OF STUDENT PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nClever understands that Student Data is generally considered to be sensitive under Canadian privacy laws and that schools must\nretain control over that Student Data. \n\nWith Clever, schools can see and control all data shared with their authorized partners in one Clever dashboard rather than having\nto access multiple systems. When a school uses Clever, it maintains complete control over what data to share and in what\ncircumstances. \n\nClever will delete Student Data and other school information from Clever’s systems upon request.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER LETS SCHOOLS MAINTAIN STRONG PRIVACY SETTINGS BY DEFAULT\n\nClever only shares data with applications that have been explicitly authorized by the school.\n\nStudent Data is private by design. Schools are able to minimize the amount of student information shared with third party\napplications. Role-based access allows authorized district users to access only the features they need, without being able to\nmodify important settings. And Clever proactively prevents end-user mistakes from leaking unauthorized data by placing automatic\nsecurity holds on unusual data transfers.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER DOES NOT RENT OR SELL DATA, PERMIT ADVERTISING OR PROFILE STUDENTS\n\nClever does not sell or monetize Student Data. Clever does not display advertising to students through Clever’s services. Clever\ndoes not profile students based on their behaviour. Clever does not allow behavioral tracking by any third parties on Clever for\nthe purpose of targeted advertising or to show ads on Clever. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER DOES NOT USE BIOMETRICS \n\nClever does not sell or monetize Student Data. Clever does not display advertising to students through Clever’s services. Clever\ndoes not profile students based on their behaviour. Clever does not allow behavioral tracking by any third parties on Clever for\nthe purpose of targeted advertising or to show ads on Clever. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER HAS A COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY PROGRAM\n\nClever’s comprehensive security program is designed to secure Student Data from loss, unauthorized access, unauthorized use,\nunauthorized alternation and unauthorized disclosure. In accordance with Canadian legal obligations, Clever considers the\nsensitivity of the information in designing its security practices. Clever regularly aligns its security practices with the\ninternationally recognized NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Clever’s Security Overview describes Clever’s approach to security. To\ndive deeper, please see the Clever Security Practices.\n\nAs part of Clever’s security program, Clever evaluates its vendors and works with vendors that meet Clever’s standards. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS OF STUDENT DATA\n\nClever’s robust security practices allow Canadian schools to access and use Clever’s services hosted in the United States.\nCanadian laws do not prohibit the use of U.S.-based cloud services as long as the student personal information is protected in an\nequivalent manner as it would be in Canada. In Nova Scotia, schools may also need permission of the head of the school board as\ndefined under the Nova Scotia Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.\n\nClever is also a proud signatory of the Student Data Privacy Pledge, a member of the Student Data Privacy Consortium, the first\nrecipient of the IMS TrustEd Apps Seal, and have received CommonSense Privacy Program’s highest possible rating, \"Use\nResponsibly,\" based on a full privacy evaluation.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\nClever does not have a one-size fits all privacy impact assessment because each school’s use of the Clever platform may vary\ndepending on how the school configures the Clever platform services. \n\nHowever, Clever understands that public bodies in Canada and some private sector organizations are required to conduct privacy\nimpact assessments or PIAs. Clever makes information publicly available on its privacy practices: Working with schools to\nsafeguard data privacy. We are here to help if a school needs to conduct a PIA and Clever’s publicly available information does\nnot provide all of the information the school needs.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER’S PRIVACY TEAM\n\nEvery member of the Clever team is responsible for ensuring that Clever meets its commitments with respect to Student Data.\nClever’s privacy team can be contacted at: trust@clever.com .\n\nFor more information on privacy, see this page: Working with schools to safeguard data privacy."

Logins may be impacted\n6. Alternatives to having your own account\n7. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOften charter schools (and sometimes small districts) share a Student Information System (SIS) with other schools or a larger\nschool district.  Since Clever syncs data from your SIS, many districts and schools in this scenario share a Clever account,\nhowever, there are times when a district or school may prefer to maintain its own Clever account. Below are a few items to take\ninto consideration when choosing if your school should manage its own Clever account.\nNOTE\nIf your SIS is managed by a separate team (e.g. a school district or charter school network), you will want to reach out to that\nteam to consider the following information together. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEXPORTING YOUR DATA\n\nIf you share an SIS account with a district or group of schools, you'll need to know how to export and upload just your school’s\ndata. \n\nThis can be done via an SFTP Sync, but you may need to work with the district or charter network team to ensure just your school’s\ndata is exported. Clever isn't able to provide guidance on the export process from your SIS when using an SFTP sync. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMUNICATE CHANGES WITH APPLICATIONS\n\nAre you currently syncing data to any applications through the existing Clever account? If so, please contact your application\nrepresentative if you are anticipating a change to your existing Clever account. Creating a new Clever account will provision\nusers with new Clever IDs, potentially impacting historical data within connected applications. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHISTORIC DATA\n\nIf you have any students or teachers currently accessing an existing district account, Clever won't be able to preserve historical\ndata across these accounts.  Individual application partners may be able to assist, but you will need to reach out to them\ndirectly.\n\nAdditionally, if you have students who are highly transient (move between schools in the district or charter network frequently),\nplease consider that these students will not have data preserved as they potentially move between Clever accounts.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLOGINS MAY BE IMPACTED\n\nIf multiple schools share a Google Admin Console, Badges into Chromebooks can only be supported for one Clever account. The setup\nfor Badges into Chromebooks requires the unique sign-in/sign-out URL for Clever, and this can only be input in Google once.\n\nClever Admin cannot have the same email address on multiple Clever accounts. If you wish to have the same admins on multiple\naccounts, a unique email address will be necessary for each account.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nALTERNATIVES TO HAVING YOUR OWN ACCOUNT\n\nMany large districts prefer to use the School Tech Lead role to help manage individual school accounts within a larger district\naccount.\n\nSchool Tech Leads have additional permissions such as the ability to customize their school’s Clever Portal, utilize School Site\nSharing to control their school’s sharing rules for applications, and help with troubleshooting logins for users in their school.\nFor more information on School Tech Leads please see our articles Clever Roles: School Tech Lead and Sharing Permissions: Enabling\nSchool Site Sharing for School Tech Leads.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n\nCan I use a Clever-Managed Auto Sync or API Sync for an individual account if I share a Student Information System (SIS)?\n\n * This depends on your SIS. Reach out to Clever Support for additional information.\n\nIf I choose to share a Clever account with my district/network, can I update the emails for just my school? \n\n * It's common for districts to have one email domain stored in their SIS, while an individual school may also have its own unique\n   domain. If you need to update emails in the existing account to reflect your preferred domain for student logins, you can do so\n   by manually side-loading emails. See our article Manually Uploading (i.e. side-loading) User Emails to Clever for more\n   information, or reach out to Clever Support for additional assistance.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles: \n\n * Clever Roles: School Tech Lead \n * Sharing Permissions: Enabling School Site Sharing for School Tech Leads\n * Manually Uploading (i.e. side-loading) User Emails to Clever"

Third-party assessment\n6. Statewide Information Security Manual\n7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn May 2023, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NC DPI) released new data security standards for any system that\nreceives student information from a statewide system. Since Clever connects to the North Carolina student information system\n(SIS), we understand that these requirements apply to Clever. This article will provide districts with information and materials\nabout Clever’s compliance with these new requirements. \n\nThe requirements go into effect January 1, 2024 (originally August 1, 2023), and must be met before any new service agreement or\nrenewal can be signed. Clever’s Secure Sync service does not operate on a renewal schedule, however, we still intend to meet the\nrequirements on or before August 1, 2023, to give school districts assurance of compliance and non-interruption of service. \n\nThe North Carolina requirements are:\n\n 1. Signed Data Confidentiality and Security Agreement for Online Service Providers and Public School Units (Student Data)\n 2. Completed Third-Party Collection Worksheet\n 3. Completed Vendor Readiness Assessment Report (VRAR) self-assessment \n 4. Third-Party Assessment Report\n 5. Compliance with North Carolina’s Statewide Information Security Manual\n     \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNORTH CAROLINA DPA\n\nNC DPI has determined that all vendors who connect with North Carolina’s statewide SIS need to sign the Data Confidentiality and\nSecurity Agreement for Online Service Providers and Public School Units (Student Data) (“DCSA”) in whole with no modifications.\nPlease follow this DocuSign link to access a pre-signed version of the document. Using the link, you may countersign and download\nyour own copy of the DCSA. If you have trouble with DocuSign, please contact legal@clever.com to find a different process.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHIRD-PARTY COLLECTION WORKSHEET\n\nPlease follow this link to access a completed Third Party Collection Worksheet using the NC DPI’s required template. You can fill\nout the top portion with your own school district’s information and keep a copy for your records.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVENDOR READINESS ASSESSMENT REPORT (VRAR)\n\nPlease follow this link to access Clever’s signed and completed VRAR self-assessment using the NC DPI’s required template.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHIRD-PARTY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\nThe NC DPI requires a third-party conducted security assessment report, such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (FedRAMP) authorization, SOC (Security Operations Center) 2 Type 2 audit, ISO 27001 certification, or HITRUST\ncertification, dated within the last 12 months.\n\n\nClever has obtained and intends to maintain a SOC 2 Type 2 Security report on an annual basis. The SOC 2 organization requires\nthat an NDA be entered into before sharing the report with existing or potential customers.  If you are a school district that is\nconnected to or connecting to Clever, please click this link to sign an NDA if you would like to review a copy of our report.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSTATEWIDE INFORMATION SECURITY MANUAL\n\nThe NC DPI requires alignment with the Statewide Information Security Manual. While Clever complies with a majority of the\nelements, there are some gaps that we expect to close during the next year during our SOC 2 Type 2 assessment process. In the\nmeantime, if you would like to review Clever’s most recent penetration testing and/or vulnerability scans, please sign an NDA\nusing this DocuSign link and we will provide a copy to the email address of the person signing the document. If you have trouble\nwith DocuSign, please contact legal@clever.com to find a different process.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nWhere can I find out more information about the North Carolina requirements?\n\n * The North Carolina DPI has created a website to provide schools and vendors information about the new requirements and updates.\n\nWhat if I have more questions about Clever’s compliance with the North Carolina requirements?\n\n * Please contact legal@clever.com if you have any additional questions.\n\n \n\nRelated Resources: \n\n * For Families: Clever security policies for student data\n * To learn more about data privacy, you can read Clever's full Privacy Policy\n * To learn more about our security practices, you can read our comprehensive security program"

Examples of these emails include:\n\n 1. Shared district resources\n 2. Password retrieval\n 3. Changes in terms of service\n 4. Product notifications\n\n\nTEACHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\nTeachers will only receive professional development and news and product update emails from Clever if:\n\n * Their district has subscribed them to receive emails from the Clever Dashboard SSO & Portal > Communications page.\n * They have a teacher account in Clever.\n * The teacher has not unsubscribed themselves from receiving Clever emails.\n * Their district has committed to using the Clever Portal throughout the school year.\n\nService-related emails are critical for account functionality; for this reason, they are not subject to the district or teacher's\nemail subscription settings. However, teachers can disable service-related emails by using the unsubscribe link in the email(s)\nthey receive. In addition, teachers will only receive service-related emails from Clever if their user account is synced with\nClever.\n\nUnsubscribe: Every teacher email will contain a clear unsubscribe link providing the ability to opt out of receiving Clever\nemails.\n\nThird-parties: Clever promises to never rent, sell or share teacher email addresses with third-party vendors for marketing\npurposes, per Clever's privacy policy.\n\n\nCLEVER'S TEACHER EMAIL POLICY\n\nClever receives frequent requests from teachers and districts for more information about Clever utilization best practices. Our\nemail content helps equip teachers with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed, whether teaching from school or remotely.\nOur goal is to help teachers save time while managing their digital classrooms and staying connected with students and families or\nguardians. In addition, we provide them with resources that enable them to address questions and issues quickly and\nindependently. \n\nAside from professional development and news/product updates, Clever also sends service-related emails or account alerts to\nteachers (e.g., resetting password emails, downloading Clever Badges, etc.). These transactional emails facilitate the teacher's\nlogin and use of Clever according to the features contracted and enabled by the district and are often critical to account\nfunctionality. \n\nWe're excited to help teachers get the most out of the Clever Portal for their classroom and continue to save them valuable\nteaching time!"

The partnership between the two companies, with\ndistinct and highly complementary offerings, provides improved learning solutions and offerings for U.S. schools and districts\nwhile accelerating the global expansion of Clever's solutions. Clever's big vision includes reaching even more students and\nworking on new ways to make learning more enjoyable. We are thrilled that joining the Kahoot! Group will make that vision a\nreality even sooner. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DOES THIS AFFECT CURRENT CLEVER CUSTOMERS?\n\nWhile we're excited about the changes, rest assured that we haven't changed. Clever is continuing to do what we do best. Our\nteam's dedication to incredible customer support and reliability is unchanging. Our industry-leading commitment to student data\nprivacy, security, and compliance is only getting stronger and will continue to be a key focus when scaling internationally.\nFinally, our innovative business model (i.e., working with our app customers to offer Clever's Digital Learning Platform to\ndistricts for free) isn't changing. We're remaining an open platform, accessible to all schools and companies. \nWe do not expect that the acquisition will result in any significant changes at this time (or in the future) for existing Kahoot!\nor Clever customers. Both Kahoot! and Clever customers can expect business as usual and continue using both platforms as they did\nbefore. Over time, the ambition is to deliver an even more robust experience for all customers on the platform. The Clever\nplatform will continue to be an open platform.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWILL THERE BE ANY CHANGES TO CLEVER’S EXISTING DATA PRIVACY POLICIES? \n\nClever remains fully committed to honoring all of the privacy practices documented in our current privacy policy as well as the\ncommitments we've made to protect student data while complying with COPPA, FERPA, state student data privacy laws, and all\ncontractual agreements. However, as Clever's international presence grows, we will need to expand our privacy and security\ncompliance and data management programs to comply with local laws in other countries. As a result, you will likely see changes to\nour privacy policy as these additional protections are implemented. The acquisition will not impact Clever's privacy practices for\nour U.S. clients and partners. Clever's school, district, and student data will be protected as it is today and will not be\nimpacted by the acquisition by Kahoot!. All U.S. student data will continue to be stored in the U.S.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHEN WILL CLEVER ROSTERING AND SSO BE AVAILABLE FOR MY INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS (SCHOOL DISTRICTS)?\n\nLearn more about using Clever internationally here. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW WILL KAHOOT! AND CLEVER INTEGRATE THEIR PLATFORMS?\n\nWe are actively building a plan for how Kahoot! and Clever will operate synergistically, including with regard to partner\nintegrations. We are two companies with the potential to grow stronger, empowering users (e.g., districts, schools, teachers,\nstudents, parents, and lifelong learners) globally with industry-leading EdTech tools and resources. Our two teams will have a\ntalent force of over 500 employees, leveraging deep application and product development expertise, technology, marketing, and\nengineering capabilities to deliver innovative solutions to customers worldwide. Kahoot! 's global learning community will also\nhave the opportunity to discover the benefits of Clever, while Clever's app partners will be able to reach an international\naudience through Kahoot! 's global presence."

Choose your identity provider (IdP)\n5. After onboarding, roll out Clever to your schools!\n6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nGetting started with the Clever? Check out our onboarding courses, available in Clever Academy!\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWelcome to Clever! We’re so excited to get you set up. Clever offers many features, and getting started with the basics is easy.\n\nFor the best onboarding experience, we encourage you to access the onboarding courses listed above in Clever Academy once you have\nset up your Clever account. It’s a comprehensive resource to guide you in setting up Clever!\n\nBelow is a summary of the four essential steps to get your Clever account running. The first three steps are part of your\nonboarding journey, and the fourth is to get your schools using Clever so they can benefit from it!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSTEP 1: CONNECT YOUR STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (SIS)\n\nTo start, you need to connect your SIS to Clever so we can help you share data you designate with relevant apps. Syncing data with\nClever can be done with any SIS. Your sync is what sends information from your SIS to Clever so that we can share the data you\nauthorize with the applications you specify. \n\nNavigate to the Sync Settings page in the district dashboard and find your SIS from the drop-down menu. If you can’t find your SIS\nlisted here, choose Other. \n\nThere are three ways to sync data to Clever: \n\n\n * Clever-managed Auto Sync\n * SIS-managed Auto Sync\n * SFTP Sync\n\nFor any SIS-Managed or SFTP syncs, our teams have limited insight into the export processes within your SIS. Please work with your\nSIS team directly for any questions on how to export data from their system.\n\nIf you need guidance on what sync type you should use, you can learn more here: Which sync type should I choose? \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSTEP 2: ADD APPLICATIONS\n\nClever seamlessly syncs data with any of your schools' applications, or apps, that you connect to Clever. Examples include\nNewsela, Reading A-Z, and Mathspace.\n\nTo add an application, navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add applications page, and then request your desired\napplication(s). \n\nOnce you’ve requested a learning application, each app partner has its own approval process. If you have questions about getting\nyour request approved, impacts on existing application data, or changes to the login flow for your students and teachers, please\nreach out to the application partner directly.\n\n \n\nSharing Data\n\nAfter you have added a new application to Clever, you’ll need to set data sharing permissions for the application. Sharing\npermissions specify what data you want to make available to a specific application.\n\n * From the Applications page, find your newest application(s) from your list of connected learning applications. \n\n * On the right side, choose Share data now. \n   \n    \n\nFind more information about sharing data with new applications here: Sharing Permissions: Sharing data with new applications.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSTEP 3: CHOOSE YOUR IDENTITY PROVIDER (IDP)\n\nIf you decide to utilize the Clever Portal, you'll choose how students, teachers, and staff will log into Clever and access all\nyour online learning applications in one place with a single click!\n\nTo set up single sign-on (SSO):\n\n 1. Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings page.\n\n 2. Choose the identity provider (e.g. Google, Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) that works best for users in your school district.\n    Find more information here: Single Sign-On (SSO): identity provider (IdP) Options.\n\nOur Help Center offers step-by-step instructions for how to set up each login method within your Clever Dashboard: Single Sign-On\n(SSO): Identity Provider (IDP)/Login Method Options.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: ROLL OUT\n\nWhoohoo! Now it’s time to share the exciting news with your teachers and make sure they’re all set.\n\nIf you’ve chosen to use Clever Portal with your district, Navigate to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Portal settings page to\nprovide instructions on how they will access Clever. You can find instructions to download on your Clever Dashboard as shown in\nthis screenshot: \n\n\n\nIf you’re using Clever just for rostering, make sure all apps your schools are using are added to Clever, and ensure teachers know\nhow to log in to them.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nIs there a quick list to walk me through the steps of setting up my Clever account?\n\n * Yes! We’ve created customized resources for districts and schools just getting started with Clever. Check out our Clever Admin\n   Onboarding checklist and Onboarding Quick Start Guides for a handheld approach to setting up your account.\n\nWho do I contact if I have questions as I work on setting up my account?\n\n * You should have received a welcome email with detailed setup instructions when your Clever account was created. Please respond\n   directly to this email with any questions and your dedicated Onboarding Specialist will respond to assist you. If you cannot\n   find the email or any other emails from your onboarding specialist, please feel free to reach out directly to our support team\n   at support.clever.com and they will put you in touch with your Onboarding Specialist.\n\nCan I add other administrators to help with account setup?\n\n * Yes! Navigate to the Team Page of your Clever account and follow the steps in our article: Clever Roles: Clever Admin.\n\nWhat if I don’t know how to export data from my SIS?\n\n * Check out our onboarding resources in Clever Academy, or reach out to your district/school’s onboarding specialist and they can\n   share where you can find additional instructions.\n\n * With SFTP syncs, we have limited insight into how to export data from your SIS. We recommend reaching out directly to your SIS\n   for the best assistance with any SIS-specific export instructions for your SFTP sync.\n\nWhat if I don’t have a SIS?\n\n * You can manually create and upload CSV files to sync your data to Clever.\n\nHow long does it take to set up my Clever account?\n\n * This varies for each district and school depending on your SIS, sync type, and the applications you hope to set up. Most\n   schools can have their data sync and first application launched for rostering within a week!\n\nHow do I know when I have completed onboarding with Clever?\n\n * You can expect a congratulatory email from your Onboarding Specialist when you have completed Clever onboarding. This email\n   will provide next-step resources and instructions on how to reach our support team for any further assistance needed beyond\n   onboarding.\n\nWhat are my next steps after syncing data, setting up an application, and adding a login method?\n\n * Check out Clever Academy for more information on Clever Core and Clever+ tools! Once you have completed the onboarding process,\n   please reach out to our support team with any questions about troubleshooting or resources to help you further utilize Clever."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Clever-Managed Auto Sync\n3. SIS-Managed Auto Sync\n4. SFTP Syncs\n\n\nXX\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever is compatible with all Student Information Systems (SIS), and depending on the SIS we offer a Clever-Managed Auto Sync, an\nSIS-Managed Auto Sync, or an SFTP Sync. The following information helps to explain the three supported sync types: \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNC\n\nHow does it work?\n\n * For Clever-Managed Auto Syncs, Clever has written an integration that exports data directly from the SIS and securely transfers\n   it to Clever.\n * For these syncs, Clever requires configured credentials to access your SIS. As with all Clever syncs, you will still have\n   complete control over data sharing and management of your Clever account.\n\nCan I customize what roster data is synced?\n\n * The ability to customize data for Clever-Managed Auto Syncs is limited, but we may be able to remove unwanted fields or include\n   additional fields in your sync to meet your district’s needs. Contact our Support Team to request help.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\n * Before signing up for a Clever account, create a Clever read-only account in your SIS. \n\n \n\n Check out this article for a complete list of Clever-Managed Auto Syncs!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSIS-MANAGED AUTO SYNC\n\nHow does it work?\n\n * For SIS-Managed Auto Syncs, Clever has partnered directly with the SIS provider to offer an automated sync option. Clever does\n   not require credentials or access to the SIS directly.\n * To take advantage of these SIS-managed syncs, select the 'Automatic' option during signup, and Clever will provide instructions\n   to initiate the sync from your SIS to Clever.\n * In most cases, you will need to share Clever sync credentials with your SIS provider, and the SIS will generate and regularly\n   upload data to Clever on your behalf. As with all Clever syncs, you will still have complete control over data sharing and\n   management of your Clever account.\n\nCan I customize what roster data is synced? \n\n * If you have questions about customizing, please contact your SIS directly.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\n * After creating your Clever account, navigate to the Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings page for instructions on how to activate\n   your SIS-Managed Auto Sync.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSFTP SYNCS\n\nHow does it work?\n\n * The SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) Sync option allows school districts to “push” data to Clever. Clever provides\n   credentials for Secure File Transfer Protocol as well as a web-based upload option, and districts generate files to upload to\n   their accounts.\n * Clever recommends that you investigate automating the process for exporting and uploading data via SFTP; regular uploads to\n   Clever mean current data in your apps.\n\nWhich student information systems (SIS) are available?\n\n * SFTP Sync is available for all SISs.\n\nCan I customize what roster data is synced?\n\n * Because districts control exactly what data to include in their upload files, this option provides districts a greater level of\n   customization but requires a more robust setup and management.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\n * To learn more about the data upload process for districts using SFTP Sync, see SFTP Syncs: What is the sync process? \n * If you are interested in automating your SFTP uploads, Clever supports data ingestion via nightly SFTP transmission to a secure\n   SFTP server. While this method does not allow for real-time data uploads and requires additional configuration, it may be a\n   useful option for schools whose IT Departments have already prepared SFTP scripts. The SFTP data transfer to Clever requires\n   the submission of multiple files in a specific CSV format.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help!"

Clever is designed to work for districts with multiple schools, but charter and private schools can also\ncreate Clever accounts.\n \n\n\nTHINGS TO CONSIDER\n\nCharter and private schools:\n\n * Student Information System (SIS): Clever is designed to sync student data from your SIS, but we understand that many private\n   and charter schools do not have an SIS. You can find a list of our SIS partners here. If you do not have an SIS or do not see\n   your SIS on the list, you will have to create CSV files and upload them via SFTP.\n * Team size: Clever setup is most successful when there is a dedicated technology team setting up the account. It is important to\n   consider who will set up and run the account before signing up.\n\nLocal school district: \n\n * If your private school or charter school is not managed by a local school district, you will likely not find your school name\n   on the drop-down menu when signing up. If this is the case, please “Add” your school name and do not sign up as a district.\n\nDistricts with six schools or fewer:\n\n * Syncing: When completing your first sync, you can find more information in these articles:\n   * SIS Partners\n   * Which sync option should you choose?\n   * Sync Error: What are \"Insufficient Permissions\"? \n   * Sync Error: How do I resolve \"Invalid username/password specified\"?\n   * All other Secure Sync topics\n\n\n \n\n If you are still interested in using Clever and ready to sign up, please visit our Self-Service Guides on Secure Sync and Single\nSign-on (SSO)."

Adding authentication methods\n5. Using MFA after setup\n6. Viewing MFA activation status\n7. Admin access control\n8. Resetting MFA for admin users from the Team Page\n9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever offers all Clever Admin complimentary multi-factor authentication (MFA for short) to provide an extra layer of security for\nadmin accounts (Clever Admin, Curriculum Lead, or District Help Desk). This article explains what MFA is, and how to set it up for\nyour Clever account. \n \n\nIMPORTANT\nSecure logins are required for all Clever Admins, either using multi-factor authentication (MFA) or single sign-on (SSO)\n\nWhy is this being required?\nLogin credentials can be subject to malicious attacks, resulting in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information\n(PII). As a trusted guardian of sensitive data, we want to support you in curbing ever-evolving threats and keeping your logins\nsafe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT’S MFA?\n\nMFA is a way to log in to programs that requires you to use two methods (or factors) to prove your identity, like your username\nand password on your computer and a text message code sent to your phone. You likely already use MFA when signing in to other\nprograms, such as your online bank account.\n \n\nPlease note: If you've previously set up two-factor authentication in Clever for your admin account using the Authy authentication\napp or SMS, you can now upgrade your authentication method to any of the new, even more secure choices: Google and Microsoft\nauthenticator apps, hardware tokens, and voice messages.\n\n\nHaving two methods makes it much harder for someone to hack into your account because they’d need to have access to both your\nusername/password and the second method you used to prove your identity. The more protected your account credentials are, the\nsafer your account!\n\nTo use MFA, you’ll need to add an authentication method, such as a text message, phone call, or push notification to your phone.\nThis is how MFA confirms your identity in addition to your normal username/password.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP MFA\n\nPlease note: If you’re an admin trying to set up Clever MFA for your district users (such as teachers and staff), please reference\nthis article. \n\n \n\n 1. Go to Clever Dashboard > Profile. \n 2. Under the Multi-factor authentication section, click Activate MFA. If you previously had set up two-factor authentication\n    (TFA/2FA), click Upgrade MFA.\n 3. Clever's supported authentication methods will be presented. You can learn more about authentication options below.  Choose a\n    method and click Next step. \n 4. Follow the instructions to set up the authentication method.\n 5. Optional: If you’d like to add more than one authentication method, click Set up another method to add another authentication\n    option. \n 6. Click Exit settings. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDING AUTHENTICATION METHODS\n\nYou must add at least one authentication method to use MFA. Authentication method options are listed below.\n\nIt’s a good practice to add at least one other authentication method that is available so you can have a backup method. This way,\nif you are not able to use one method for any reason (e.g. your cell phone is not charged so you can’t receive a text message) you\ncan use a backup method to successfully log in. This saves time by providing multiple options.\n\nPlease note: Clever only supports US numbers for SMS and voice calls at this time.\n\n \n\n\nTEXT MESSAGE (ALSO CALLED SMS) \n\nA numeric code is texted to a cell phone number you choose; you can type this code into your Clever login screen.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * Text message requires cellular service. If you do not have reliable cellular service in your work environment, we do not\n   recommend this authentication method. Please consider: Mobile app\n * Be sure you can access your cellphone during the school day, as you’ll need the code texted to this number to log in to\n   Clever. \n * Text message will not work for a landline. If you can only access a landline, consider an automated voice phone call.\n * International phone number support: if your country code is not currently supported, please use an alternate method like Mobile\n   app. The Mobile app method will work with most time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps.\n\n \n\nWhy don’t we support Email as an authentication method? That's because your account password can be reset using your email. Using\nMFA with email would provide a single point of failure: a malicious actor could both reset your password and access your account\nwith your email account.\n\n  \n\n\nAUTOMATED VOICE PHONE CALL \n\nA numeric code is shared via an automated voice phone call to a number you choose (can be a landline or cell phone); you then type\nthis code into your Clever login screen.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * This will trigger a phone call to the number you added, so ensure you’ll be able to answer the phone and hear the code shared.\n * International phone number support: if your country code is not currently supported, please use an alternate method like Mobile\n   app. The Mobile app method will work with most time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps.\n * If you need to update the phone number, you will need to remove this factor and re-add the factor with the new number.\n   * To remove an authentication method from MFA:\n     1. Click on Profile in the top-right of the Clever Dashboard  \n     2. Under Multi-factor authentication, click Settings  \n     3. Click on the authentication you would like to remove and click Remove, and click Confirm\n     4. When complete, click Exit settings\n\n  \nMobile app \n\nYou install an app on a cell phone that provides you with a numeric code you type into your Clever login screen.\n\nSetup tip:\n\n * Mobile app is highly recommended by Clever. It is highly secure and is available even if you do not have cell service.\n * To access this option, you’ll need to install an authenticator app to a cell phone and follow the MFA setup steps in Clever, so\n   be sure you’ll have access to the phone during the school day.\n   * Mobile authentication apps do NOT require cellular service or an internet connection to generate an authentication code. This\n     makes it a great option for those with poor service at school.\n * To set up the mobile app method you will need to scan a QR code or use the authenticator key with your time-based one time\n   password (TOTP) mobile app. See the instructions for your mobile app for how to scan QR codes or use authenticator keys.\n * Clever supports one Mobile app configuration per account. Check the instructions of your Mobile app to see if you can mirror\n   your configuration across multiple devices. If you wish to use a different Mobile app or reconfigure on a different device, you\n   will need to remove the mobile app authentication configuration associated with your current device and re-add mobile app\n   authentication using your new app or device.\n\n \nSetup steps, Google Authenticator App:\n\n 1. On your cell phone, install the app by searching “Google Authenticator App” in the Google Play Store (Android) or the App\n    Store (Apple). The app icon looks like this:\n\n\n \nYou can also click the links below to access the download page for the apps, but be sure to install the app on your phone, not\nyour computer:\n     \n 2. On your computer, in the Clever Dashboard, navigate to Dashboard > Profile > MFA > Settings.\n 3. Click Mobile app and click Next step. A QR code will appear. \n 4. On your cell phone, open the authenticator app and select Scan a QR code. You may need to grant permission for the app to use\n    your phone’s camera. \n 5. Scan the QR code on the computer screen using your phone’s camera. \n 6. After scanning the code, click Next step on your computer.\n 7. On your cell phone, the app will provide you with a code. On your computer, enter this code into the provided space on the MFA\n    setup screen. \n 8. Click Done.\n 9. Click Exit Settings. You’re all set.\n\nAfter this initial setup, when prompted to use MFA, you won’t need to scan a QR code: you’ll just open the Google Authenticator\nApp and tap on the account you added. You’ll be provided with a numeric code to type into Clever.\n \n  \nSetup steps, Microsoft Authenticator App:\n\n 1. On your cell phone, install the app by searching “Microsoft Authenticator App” in the Google Play Store (Android) or the App\n    Store (Apple). The app icon looks like this:\n\n\nYou can also click the links below to access the download page for the apps, but be sure to install the app on your phone, not\nyour computer:\n     \n 2.  On your computer, in the Clever Dashboard, navigate to Dashboard > Profile > MFA > Settings.\n 3.  Click Mobile app and click Next step. A QR code will appear.\n 4.  From your phone, open the authenticator app, and review any user/privacy terms. If prompted to log in, you can press Skip in\n     the top right corner (unless you have an account your district has given you directions to log into).\n 5.  Press the Add account button, then Work or school account, then select Scan a QR code. You may need to grant permission for\n     the app to use your phone’s camera. \n 6.  Scan the QR code on the computer screen using your phone’s camera. \n 7.  After scanning the code, click Next step on your computer.\n 8.  On your cell phone, the app will provide you with a code. On your computer, enter this code into the provided space on the\n     MFA setup screen. \n 9.  Click Done.\n 10. Click Exit Settings. You’re all set.\n\n\nAfter this initial setup, when prompted to use MFA, you won’t need to scan a QR code: you’ll just open the Microsoft Authenticator\nApp and tap on the account you added. You’ll be provided with a numeric code to type into Clever.\n \n\n\nSECURITY KEY \n\nA security key (such as a USB device) is used to verify the login.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * To access this option, you’ll need a district-provided physical key, or an enabled device (such as Touch ID for Macs) each time\n   you need to verify your identity with MFA.\n * You can setup up to 4 biometrics or security keys (e.g., TouchID, FaceID, or 2 Yubikeys)\n\n\nSetup steps:\n\n 1. From the MFA setup screen, select Security Key.\n 2. You may see a prompt from your computer asking you which option you’d like.\n 3. Insert your security key into your device (if relevant) and/or place your fingerprint on the sensor.\n 4. We’ll verify the security key and then verify that setup is complete.\n 5. Click Exit settings. You’re all set.\n\n\nAfter this initial setup, when prompted to use MFA, you’ll simply plug in your Security key (and touch it to verify fingerprint,\nif applicable).\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nUSING MFA AFTER SETUP\n\nAfter initial setup, you will be prompted to use MFA upon every login to Clever.\n\nYou can elect to have MFA remember a device for 7 days by clicking the checkmark (you’ll need to select this for each device, and\nfor each MFA method separately). Remembering a device works when you are timed out or close a tab. Remembering will be reset any\ntime you log out.\n\n\n\nWhenever you are required to use MFA (be that every time or every seven days), you’ll need access to one of the methods you set\nup, be that your cell phone, a landline number you used to set up voice calls with, or your security key. \n\nYou won’t be able to access your Clever account if you don’t have access to one of the method(s) you use to set up MFA if you are\nprompted to use MFA. If you have lost access to all MFA authentication methods, please contact Clever Support to request\nassistance with account recovery.\n\nLogin logs on your Clever Dashboard are able to show District Admin logins, including if they used MFA and which MFA method they\nused. However, they will not show failed login/password attempts (i.e. if a DA enters the wrong password there will not be a log\nin the corresponding login logs), but the logs will show failed MFA attempts.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVIEWING MFA ACTIVATION STATUS \n\nOnce enabled, Clever Admins that have not activated MFA will see the following prompt on their next login: \n\n\n\n\nThe MFA status of any Clever Admin is available at Clever Dashboard > Team. Use this information to contact any Clever Admins who\nneed to activate MFA to keep your Clever account as secure as possible! \n\nPlease note that you won’t see any status for School Tech Leads on the Team page. If you’d like to add MFA for School Tech Leads,\nplease consider the Clever MFA add-on for teachers and staff.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADMIN ACCESS CONTROL\n\nTo simplify account security, you can choose how users with admin roles should log into Clever. \nFrom your Clever Dashboard>Team>Access Control tab, you can select from the following options by clicking Edit:\n\n\n\n * Password login: \n   * All admins can log into the Clever Dashboard with a Clever password. If this option is disabled, admin users will have to use\n     a Clever-supported IdP to access their Clever Dashboard.\n   * Users with the Clever Account Owner role can use a password regardless of whether this setting is disabled and are required\n     to use MFA.\n   * Examples for a district using Google SSO to access Clever:\n     * When enabled: admins can use their email and password to log in at schools.clever.com or can log in using Google at\n       your district's portal login URL\n     * When disabled: admins must use Google to log in at your district's portal login URL\n * MFA with IdP (SSO):\n   * All admins will not use MFA through Clever when logging in with a Clever-supported IdP to Clever Dashboard.\n   * You can disable MFA through Clever for admins to log in with a Clever-supported IdP to access their Clever Dashboard.\n   * Examples for a district using Google SSO to access Clever:\n     * When enabled: admins will be required to use Clever MFA when accessing Clever using Google at your district's portal login\n       URL\n     * When disabled: admins will not be required to use Clever MFA when accessing Clever using Google at your district's portal\n       login URL, but may have been required to use Google MFA to access their Google accounts, which is strongly recommended.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRESETTING MFA FOR ADMIN USERS FROM THE TEAM PAGE\n\nClever Admins can reset the MFA settings for other admin user types including Clever Admins, District Help Desk, and District\nCurriculum Leads. For security, the Clever Admin Owner account MFA settings can only be reset by contacting Clever Support. You\ncan determine the Clever Admin Owner using the Role column on the Team Page of your district dashboard. We strongly encourage\nClever Admin Owners to set up multiple methods to provide back-up access if their primary method becomes unavailable. See FAQ:\n\"What are some good complementary methods to set up to provide a back-up access method for yourself?\"\n\nWhen MFA settings are reset, the user will be instructed to reconfigure their MFA settings the next time they log into the\naccount.\n\nHow to reset MFA for another admin\nFrom the Team Page of your district dashboard select the Reset MFA link for the admin user you wish to reset. Confirm that you\nwould like to reset all of their MFA configurations allowing them to reconfigure on their next login.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nIf I’m having trouble getting set up with MFA, who do I contact?\n * Please contact Clever Support\n\n\nHow do I reset MFA for Clever Admin?\n * Another Clever Admin at your district can reset the MFA settings for admin users other than the Owner. See this section for\n   instructions. If the Clever Admin Owner needs to reset their MFA (they have lost access to all MFA authentication methods for\n   your user account), please contact Clever Support. We strongly encourage Clever Admin Owner users to set up multiple methods to\n   provide back-up access if their primary method becomes unavailable. See FAQ: \"What are some good complementary methods to set\n   up to provide a back-up access method for yourself?\"\n\n\nHow does MFA for Clever Admin work if I have a teacher/staff and Clever Admin role?\n * When you go to log in, you'll be presented with a role picker. If you chose your teacher/staff account, you won't be prompted\n   with MFA. If you chose Clever Admin, you'll be prompted with MFA (if you have it set up). \n\n\nWhat are some good complementary methods to set up to provide a back-up access method for yourself?\n * Complementary methods that make good back-ups use different devices. For example setting up both voice phone call and text\n   message to the same mobile device won’t provide a good back-up if your phone is unavailable. If possible try combining methods\n   across 2 or more devices. Some device options to consider when choosing 2 or more:\n   * Landline phone: if you work out of an office with a landline, consider setting up automated voice phone call on your landline\n   * Mobile phone: choose between\n     * Text message\n     * Mobile app\n   * Computer: choose between\n     * Mobile app: you can use the Mobile app setup to add any TOTP-based authentication application, many of which have desktop\n       versions.\n     * Security key: you can use either a USB device or a biometric sensor built into your device for this method\n\n\nHow do I change my default method?\n * When asked to verify your identity on the MFA entry screen while logging in, choose Change MFA method. MFA will default to the\n   most recently used method on the next login.\n\n\n\ntags: 2FA, two-factor, TFA"

We perform privacy-preserving\n   checks for passwords which have been leaked online. If a Clever Admin password matches any of these, we require the DA to reset\n   their password.\n\n\n\n\nAre there recommendations for choosing a secure password?\n * Use a password management solution like 1Password to use strong/unique passwords for all logins.\n * Combine three or four random words. For example: “student-task-fish-fly”. These combinations are usually easy to remember and\n   very secure."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Using the Data Browser\n3. Searching with filters  \n4. Is all of this data shared with applications?\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever Admins have two ways to review their district's SIS rostering data in Clever. The first method Clever Admins can use is the\nsearch bar at the top of the page from the Clever Dashboard to quickly find a specific school, student, teacher, section, staff\nmember, or application in Clever. To do this, type the user or record's name or SIS ID (e.g., teacher_id, student_id, etc.) into\nthe search bar. A dropdown list of options will populate for you to select the desired record, leading you to the user or record's\nprofile page.\n\nPlease note that school admins and Clever Admins are not searchable using the Clever search bar at the top of the Clever\nDashboard. Instead, you can search for Clever Admins from the Clever Dashboard > Team page.\n \n\n\nUSING THE DATA BROWSER\n\nThe second method for viewing your district's information in Clever is to navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Data Browser. This\ntool allows Clever Admins to view and filter the rostering data (schools.csv, teachers.csv, students.csv, sections.csv, and\nstaff.csv) currently in Clever. This includes both custom data that was created from the district's Clever Dashboard > Support\nTools > Custom Data page and data synced by your district's student information system (SIS). Clever Admins can access the Data\nBrowser from the left menu sidebar in the Clever Dashboard. \n\nOnce in the Data Browser, select the appropriate data tab at the top of the page to view district schools, students, teachers,\nstaff, sections, terms, courses, or contacts. Next, select the 'Add Filter' option to search for specific records using one or\nmore filters. Once the list populates, click the name of a record to view the record's associated details.\n\n\n\n\nSEARCHING WITH FILTERS\n\nFilters and hyperlinks allow you to easily review the data in Clever. From the appropriate tab, use the filter feature to search\nfor specific records. Then, narrow your search results by adding additional filters. Finally, click the record name to open the\nuser or record's details window.  \n\nThere are additional features available to Clever Admins from the user or record's details card. For example:\n\n * Voiding or generating Clever Badges for students (if enabled at your district).\n * Navigating to a user or record's profile page in Clever.\n * Impersonating users to access their Clever Portal(s).\n * Troubleshooting login issues\n\n \n\n\nWHAT DATA IS SHARED WITH CONNECTED APPLICATIONS?\n\nClever Admins can determine what data is shared with the district's connected applications. Clever Admins can determine which data\nis shared with the district's connected applications by setting their sharing rules. The Data Browser surfaces the district's\nentire set of rostering data in Clever, but not everything that is visible in the Data Browser is necessarily shared with every\napplication. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * Sharing Permissions: Overview\n * For District Admins: Apps - Data access\n * For District Admins: How do I view a user's Clever Portal?"

Teachers always have the same permissions, primarily\naccess to their associated sections (i.e. courses/classes), students, and applications. \n \n\n  Visit this article for more information about the teacher experience in Clever: For Teachers: What are Teacher Pages?\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDETERMINING THE BEST ROLE FOR A USER \n\nClever roles should be based on an individual's position in the district and the level of permissions the district wants them to\nhave in Clever. Users assigned Clever Admin (i.e., district admin) roles will have district-wide access with varying permissions,\nwhile users in staff roles will have more limited permissions. \n\nFor detailed information about each role, please click on the links below.\n \n\nDistrict admin roles:\n \n\n * Clever Admin\n * District Curriculum Lead\n * District Help Desk\n\n\nNon-instructional staff roles:\n \n\n * School Tech Lead\n * Portal Access\n\n\nTeacher vs. Non-instructional Staff\nA common question is whether a user should be added to Clever as a Teacher, School Tech Lead, or Staff (Portal Access Only).\n\nIf a user is responsible for teaching or assisting a student with educational content (i.e. substitute, teacher aide,\ninstructional coach, etc.), we recommend adding the user as a Teacher. Directions for adding custom teachers and associating them\nwith sections can be found here. \n\nIf a user is responsible for helping users access and use technology but is not directly responsible for the instruction of\neducational content, we recommend adding the user as a School Tech Lead. This is usually an individual with a title such as\n\"technology coach.\"\n\nIf a user does not support students in the classroom directly, we recommend adding the user as Staff (Portal Access Only). This\nrole is usually best for secretaries, custodial staff, counselors, etc.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPERMISSIONS BY ROLE\n\nPlease see the graph below for a breakdown of permissions by role.\n \n\n \n\nClever Admin\n\nDistrict Curriculum Lead\n\nDistrict Help Desk\n\nSchool\nTech Lead\n\nStaff (Portal Access Only)\n\nApplication sharing permissionsManage application sharing permissionsCan see the general permissions set up for an app but not any\nspecific information about which school(s) an app is shared with.Can see the permissions set up for an app but can't modify\npermissions.\n\nMust be enabled on a per-app basis by district admin Add or delete applications    Clever Portal permissionsSSO to applications\nvia Clever SSOCustomize Clever Portal  \nFor connected schools  Manage SSO settings    Clever Badge permissionsEnable Clever Badges for district    Manage and print Clever\nBadges \nCan print for individuals\nCan print for individuals, sections, and school site Clever Dashboard permissionsAccess Clever Dashboard View login metrics and\nconnected applications Change SIS sync settings    Access Data Browser   Access Clever Analytics\nEnable & View Edtech, Portal, and  Reports (plus SFTP transfer of Reports)\nEdtech, Portal, and  Reports\nEdtech, Portal, and  Reports\nEdtech and Portal for associated schools Access to record profiles\nCan access roster information via an application's overview page Access to support tools \nTroubleshoot Login tool Reset Clever Password for individual users  Create custom data  \nCan create individual custom sections Access Portal As \nCan only impersonate teachers.

Logging in as a Clever Admin\n6. Removing or Updating Clever Admins\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nDistricts or schools can provide multiple team members with Clever Admin access in order to assist with account management. Users\nwho are assigned the Clever Admin role (previously known as District Admin), will have district-wide access with varying\npermissions. This article will explain how to manage team members from Clever Dashboard > Team.\n\nPlease note: Clever Admins do not have the ability to impersonate other Clever Admins via the Access portal feature. For more\ninformation, visit: Impersonating a User: Access Portal as Feature  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER ACCOUNT OWNER\n\nEach Clever portal has a single account owner. The owner is indicated by the word (Owner) following their name on the Team page.\n  \n\n\nThe account owner’s name and email address are shared with applications connected to the district’s Clever account and, therefore,\nthey are the primary point of contact for all Clever-related issues.\n\nThe owner has unique privileges that are unavailable to Clever Admins which include the ability to:\n\n * Transfer account ownership to another Clever Admin \n * Delete the Clever account\n\nWith the exception of the above privileges, all Clever Admins have equal permissions to view or modify the district portal.  This\nincludes adding or removing applications, updating sharing permissions, managing Badges, and much more! \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP TO A NEW ACCOUNT OWNER\n\nEach Clever account may have only one owner at a time, and only the current owner can transfer the role to another team member. If\nyou do not see the option to Change Account Owner, then you are not the account owner.\n\nThe current Account Owner can transfer ownership to another Clever Admin by clicking the Add team member button and selecting\nChange Account Owner in the dropdown from the Clever Dashboard > Team page. This option will only be available if there are other\nClever Admins on the Clever account. Once ownership is transferred, the options to add/remove Clever Admins or transfer ownership\nwill only be available to the new Account owner. If you need to transfer the ownership to an individual who isn't currently a\nClever Admin, you'll need to first create an Admin account for them. \n\n\n\n\nIf the Clever Account Owner listed on the account is no longer with the district, please contact Clever Support for help. Here are\nthe details about what we will need to make the update on your behalf:\n\n * We will need written approval from a member of the district’s leadership team (e.g. Superintendent, Director of Technology,\n   Curriculum Director, etc.) who is verifiable on the district's website.\n * Please feel free to CC this administrator on the Clever support ticket so they can respond directly to the communication\n   thread. \n * Once Clever has written confirmation, we can transfer ownership of the district's Clever account.\n   \n   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDING CLEVER ADMINS\n\nAny users who are assigned the Clever Admin role are also able to add other Clever Admins to Clever by following these steps:\n\n 1. Log into the Clever Dashboard\n 2. Select Team from the left navigation menu\n 3. Select Add team member to the top right of the page\n 4. Add the new Clever Admin's information in the pop-up box\n 5. Select Add\n\n\n\nOnce a team member has been added to the account, they will receive an email with a link to create an account. If they do not\nreceive this message, please have them check their spam folder for a message from no-reply@clever.com. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN AS A CLEVER ADMIN\n\n\nAll Clever Admins should use the District admin log in option from the Clever login page to access their Clever Admin account.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, Clever Admins can navigate to Clever.com and choose the District admin option using the blue arrow dropdown at the\ntop right of the page.\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: Clever District Admin can also use a Single Sign-on (SSO) Identity Provider (IDP) to sign in (such as Google or\nActive Directory) that's powered by user email address. You'll just need to add the IDP to your district first.\n\nIf you prefer that all District Admin be required to use SSO to sign in to Clever instead of a username and password, please\ncontact Clever Support by clicking the message icon in the bottom right corner. You must be a Clever Admin (owner) to be able to\nmake this request. \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREMOVING OR UPDATING CLEVER ADMINS\n\n\nREMOVING CLEVER ADMINS\n\nClever Admins also have permission to remove other admins from the Team page. To remove another Clever Admin, click the trash icon\nto the far right of the user's name. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATING CLEVER ADMINS\n\nOnce a Clever Admin account has been created, other Clever Admins listed on the district account have the ability or update\nanother Admin's Title or Clever Role. To make these updates for another Clever Admin, click the pencil icon to the far right of\nthe user's name. \n\n\n\n \n\nTo update the email associated with the Clever Admin account, the admin user must log into their account > click Profile >\nOverview > Edit > update the email address > Update"

If you notice the Staff\npage of your account looks different from the documentation below, please view this article instead.\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever Admins are able to provide various non-instructional staff (i.e. non-teaching staff) access to Clever. For an overview of\nClever Roles and permissions, please see this article.\n\nClever Tip: If your district uses the Infinite Campus API or Skyward API sync type, skip below to this section for information on\nhow staff are automatically synced to Clever. And if your district used Active Directory, click here to automatically sync data to\nClever.\n\n \n\nClever intuitively knows what options are available to sync your staff based on your sync type. You can view these on your Clever\nDashboard by going to the Sync page > Staff Data tab. From there, choose which option works best for your school district.\n\nIf you’re unsure of your sync type, you can navigate to your Sync page and find out by looking under Sync Type at the top of the\npage.\n\n \n\n\n\nThis is an example of an SFTP sync type.\n\n\nFor most districts, there are two ways to add staff to Clever: \n\n 1. Staff as part of your normal Sync or a one-time Sync upload.\n 2. Custom Staff, added individually on a per-user basis.\n\nPlease see the below table to determine which method is best for your district. Please note that many districts will choose to\nmanage staff in bulk using Staff and will manually add individual accounts using Custom Staff as needed. If you use a\nClever-Managed Auto Sync that is not able to sync staff, please see this section.\n \n\n \n\nCustom Staff\n\nStaff\n\nManually create staffManually associate staff with multiple schoolsManually edit staffManually delete staffBulk create staff via\nCSVAutomate bulk create staff (CSV file)\n(SFTP districts only)Bulk associate staff with multiple schools (CSV file)Bulk edit staff (CSV file)Bulk delete staff (CSV\nfile)View staffSupport Tools > Custom Data > StaffData browserRecommended for:\nCreating individual staff\nSmall schools / districts\nMedium and large districts\nDocumentationLinkLink\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOADING STAFF FOR SFTP DISTRICTS\n\nFor SFTP syncs, there are three options to sync your staff data to Clever (which you can find on your Staff Data tab):\n\n * Via your SFTP sync\n   \n   * An SFTP client (credentials provided on your Staff Data tab)\n   * Manually upload it on the Upload tab\n * Active Directory sync\n   * If all staff members have accounts in Active Directory (AD), you can quickly sync them using our AD sync tool\n * Use custom data\n   * Individually add custom staff or make edits to existing staff data on a per-user basis - no staff.csv required\n\n\n\n \n\nFor additional information about Clever's SFTP and CSV formatting specifications, click here.\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOADING STAFF FOR AUTO SYNC DISTRICTS\n\nIf you’re unsure of your sync type, you can navigate to your Sync page and find out by looking under Sync Type at the top of the\npage.\n\nIf you're using the PowerSchool Plugin Sync and want to upload staff, please follow the instructions in this section.\n\n \n\n\n\nThis is an example of a Clever-managed auto sync.\n\nSuppose your district's student information system (SIS) isn't automatically syncing staff members to Clever (you can sync staff\nwith Infinite Campus API and Skyward API). In that case, you can navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Staff Data page to\nview the options to sync your staff to Clever. \n\n \n\nPlease note: Staff users must be explicitly shared with your learning applications once they have been created in Clever. \n\n 1. From your Clever Dashboard, select Sync > Staff Data.\n 2. You will be able to view your staff sync options as follows:\n\n * Sync staff data as part of your regular SIS auto sync, if syncing with Infinite Campus API and Skyward API\n * Active Directory\n * Custom Data\n * Upload a staff.csv file via an SFTP box (provided by Clever). Learn more about SFTP boxes here. \n   * If you use this option after your initial upload, to add more staff to Clever, open the staff.csv and add an additional row\n     for each staff member you would like to add. If you need an example file, click Download example files.\n     \n     \n\nPlease note: DO NOT REMOVE any staff users you want to be able to access Clever. Removing a user from the staff.csv before\nre-uploading it will cause their record to be deleted. Instead, add the additional user information to the file before\nre-uploading.\n\n \n\nFor additional information about Clever's SFTP and CSV formatting specifications, click here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT UPLOAD TIPS\n\nWhen uploading staff to Clever, there are a few important details to consider:\n \n\n * Each unique staff member requires a unique staff_id. \n    \n * Always include all staff in the staff.csv file if you still want them to have access to Clever. Removing a user from the\n   staff.csv before re-uploading the file will cause their record to be deleted. \n    \n * The school_id must match the school_id (i.e. sis_id) for a school in Clever. To locate this value, search for the school from\n   the top search bar and select the school to bring up the school's profile page. Under School Information, find the School ID.\n   This is the school_id value that should be used in the staff.csv.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n * For staff that are not associated with a specific school, or are associated with the district office, use the school_id value:\n   DEFAULT_DISTRICT_OFFICE\n\n * Uploaded staff are auto-assigned the role: Portal Access. Portal Access users do not have any administrative rights and will\n   only be able to Single Sign-On (SSO) to applications from their Clever Portal. Applications must first be shared with them by a\n   Clever Admin.\n * For instructions on manually adding individual staff members to Clever via the Custom Data feature, visit: Adding custom staff\n   to Clever\n\n \n\nFor information on admin and staff roles in Clever, please visit: Clever Roles: Overview of Roles & Permissions\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nASSOCIATING STAFF TO MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OR THE DISTRICT OFFICE \n\nMultiple schools:\n \n\nTo associate a staff member with multiple schools, create a separate row at each location. The only field that will be different\nfor each row is the school_id. For example, if a staff member should be associated with three schools, it should look like this:\n\n\n\n\nAll schools:\n \n\nTo associate a staff member with all schools in the district, enter school_id: district\n\n\n\n \n\nTo see which school(s) a staff member is associated with, head to your Clever Dashboard and search their name via the search bar\nat the top.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDefault District Office:\n \n\nThere is a default auto-generated district office in Clever. To associate a staff member with the district office, enter the\nschool_id: DEFAULT_DISTRICT_OFFICE\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEDITING STAFF & REMOVING STAFF OR UPDATING THEIR ROLES\n\n 1. From your Clever Dashboard, select Sync > Upload.\n 2. Under Download existing files, select staff.csv. The downloaded\n    staff.csv file will contain all pre-existing staff in Clever for your district.\n\n\n 1. Edit the records for staff as desired and save the file.\n     \n 2. Next, upload the file. When the cloud displays as green, select Upload. The staff updates will be reflected in Clever in 10-15\n    minutes.\n     \n\n\nTo update a staff member's role from Portal Access to School Tech Lead, please follow the instructions here: Clever Roles: School\nTech Lead\n \n\nPlease note: All staff members should be listed in the staff.csv every time you upload a new file to Clever! If a staff member's\nrecord is not populated in the staff.csv file, that staff member will be deleted from Clever and connected applications.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDISTRICTS USING THE INFINITE CAMPUS API OR SKYWARD API SYNC\n\nInfinite Campus API\n \n\nStaff are synced to Clever if:\n \n\n * Teacher is not checked for their district assignment in Infinite Campus.\n\n\nAll staff members that do not have 'Teacher' checked will appear as 'Administrator' in the OneRoster API and will be synced to\nClever as Staff.\n\n\nIf a user has 'Teacher' and another assignment checked. They will be synced to Clever as both a Teacher and Staff. Upon login to\nClever, they can select which user session they wish to access.\n\n\nIf you prefer greater control over which staff synced to Clever as Staff, we recommend using our manual CSV upload. Contact Clever\nSupport if you want to enable this option for your district. \n\n \n \n\nSkyward API\n \n\nStaff are synced to Clever if both conditions below are true:\n \n\n * \"Teacher = False\" (unchecked)\n * Their 'Title' is either blank or contains one of the following words:\n   * Superintendent\n   * Principal\n   * Instruction\n   * Curriculum\n   * Director\n   * Coordinator\n   * Technology\n   * Coach\n   * Counselor\n   * Admin\n\nOnce staff members have been uploaded to Clever, you must ensure they are shared with the desired applications. For instructions,\nvisit: Sharing Permissions: Sharing staff with applications\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAUTOMATED STAFF SFTP FOR AUTO SYNCS \n\nIf your schools use a Clever-Managed Auto Sync that can’t sync staff (like PowerSchool, Infinite Campus auto, Skyward auto, Aeries\nAPI, and Blackbaud) we have a solution to automate your staff data upload!\n\nThis feature provides schools with an SFTP directory that can accept a staff.csv file.  Clever will use this staff.csv file as the\nsource of truth, as this file will supersede any SIS-synced staff data. It should only be used by schools that want to automate\nstaff in this way. In situations where you can use the SIS sync or Custom data to achieve the same effect, those are preferred\nmethods.\n\nTo activate this feature, reach out to our support team at support.clever.com. Once activated, you’ll see SFTP credentials on your\nSync page under the Staff tab or you to use, as shown below. \n\n\n\nOnce you have the SFTP credentials, you can use an FTP client like Filezilla, or WinSCP, to upload your staff.csv file to the\npreferred-sis-data directory in your SFTP box.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you upload your staff.csv file to a directory other than preferred-sis-data, your data will not process, and you\nwill not receive an error message. Please ensure that your staff.csv file is uploaded to the preferred-sis-data directory.\n\n\nPlease note: staff.csv data uploaded to the preferred-sis-data directory will be processed during a sync pause. See this article\nto learn more about sync pause. If you plan to start syncing these staff members using your normal SIS sync after coming off\npause, ensure that the staff_id field in your staff.csv matches the staff_id that will be used by your SIS sync.\n\n\nLearn more about the staff.csv file and how to format it here.\n\nWho does NOT need this feature:\n\n \n\n * If you already have an SFTP directory, you would just need to automate your staff upload to that SFTP directory.\n * If you only want to upload staff manually, you would use custom data."

Overview\n2. Logging in\n3. Staff who are also teachers\n\n See this article for information on how to add your staff members into Clever!\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nYour district's non-instructional staff (i.e. non-teaching staff), or employees who do not have a designated roster in your\ndistrict's Student Information System (SIS), are referred to as staff in Clever. Occasionally, they will also be referred to as\nschool admins. The two terms are synonymous.\n \n\nHere are some examples of the types of staff members Clever supports:\n \n\n * Curriculum Leads\n * District Help Desk users\n * School-specific Tech Leads\n * Principals\n * Nurses\n * District members\n * After-school Coordinators\n\n \n\n  For information on the different types of staff members and their permissions in Clever, please see this article: Clever Roles:\nOverview of Roles & Permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN\n\nOnce you have set up staff in Clever, there are two ways for them to log in:\n \n\n 1. They can navigate to your district's Clever portal login URL  which is located in your district dashboard > Portal > Portal\n    Settings page. Staff will use the same single sign-on (SSO) method you have designated for your teachers and students (e.g. if\n    your district uses Google, staff can log in with their Google credentials).\n 2. Or from Clever.com. by selecting to log in as 'Teacher or Staff'.\n\n        \n\nPlease note: If you're using ADFS, LDAPS, or any other Identity Provider (IDP) that requires manual setup, you will need to edit\nyour claims rules to allow staff members and school admins to access Clever. If you have any questions about claims rules\nplease see this Help Center article.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSTAFF WHO ARE ALSO TEACHERS\n\nClever supports users being both teachers and staff! If an individual is both a teacher and staff in Clever, they can access both\nuser accounts using the same set of credentials. Upon entering their credentials, Clever will prompt them to select which role\nthey would like to log in with.\n \n\n\n\nAs a security measure, users with both a teacher and a staff account will be asked to re-enter their username and password after\nselecting the account they want to access. This is to protect your account in case there is a delay between your initial login\nattempt and selecting your account type. The login flow follows these steps:\n * Login at your district's Clever login page - this identifies your user\n * Select which account you want to log into, staff or teacher\n * Enter credentials a second time to access your account\n\nIf you have any questions about how district staff should access Clever, please reach out to Clever support!

These are the individuals who directly manage a\nclassroom and students. Teachers in Clever have unique tools and features that allow them to facilitate digital learning in the\nclassroom. Some resources available to teachers in Clever include:\n\n * Clever Library\n * Login Tools\n * Teacher Pages  \n * Teacher Analytics\n * Clever Messaging (if enabled by the district)   \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSTAFF\n\n\"Staff\" is the term Clever uses to refer to staff who are not directly in charge of a classroom (e.g., principal, front desk,\ncounselor, etc.). Clever has two user roles associated with the staff user type:\n\n * Portal Access:  This is the default role provided to staff members in Clever. This role provides permissions to access the\n   Clever Portal and any shared applications.\n * School Tech Lead: This role in Clever has additional permissions that allow them to manage the Clever Portal on a\n   school-by-school basis. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCAN A USER BE BOTH STAFF AND TEACHER?\n\nYes! An individual can be both a teacher and staff in Clever. In most instances, these users can access both user accounts using\nthe same set of credentials.\n\nDistricts can link teacher and staff accounts as long as the email for each record matches (this includes case sensitivity). If\nthe user has one account syncing from your student information system, and you need to make a custom account for another role for\nthat user, that's totally fine! You will just need to be sure to use the same email. To check to see if the user's accounts are\nlinked, you can search for the user in the search bar in the Clever Dashboard. If the accounts are linked you will see the\nteacher/staff toggle button (shown below).\n\n\n  \n\nThe user will log in to Clever using one set of credentials. After entering their credentials, Clever will prompt them to select\nthe role they want to log in with (shown below).\n \n\n\n\nAs a security measure, users with both a teacher and a staff account will be asked to re-enter their username and password after\nselecting the account they want to access. This is to protect your account in case there is a delay between your initial login\nattempt and selecting your account type. The login flow follows these steps:\n * Login at your district's Clever login page - this identifies your user\n * Select which account you want to log into, staff or teacher\n * Enter credentials a second time to access your account\n\nFor details about configuring sharing permissions for staff, please visit: How do I share staff with applications?\n\nPlease note: If your district uses 'Log in with Clever' for single sign-on (SSO) (in addition to a third-party Identity Provider\nlike Google), these users might have different credentials for each account. Therefore, their district admin should be able to\nprovide information around login credentials.\n\nIf having two accounts becomes too much for the user, you can remove the unwanted account (either the teacher or staff account) by\nremoving the account from the SIS sync or the custom data page if they were created as a custom user. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS AND STAFF?\n\n\n\n\nUser type in Clever:\n\nTeacher\n\nStaff\n\nUser role in Clever:\n\nTeacher\n\nSchool Tech Lead\n\nPortal Access\n\nSingle Sign-onSSO to applications via Clever✅✅✅Customize Clever Portal for school✅  Teacher PagesCreate and share Teacher\nPages✅Teacher ToolsManage and print Clever Badges✅ ✅2 Generate backup login codes✅  Reset student passwords1✅ Log a class of\nstudents into an application✅ Log a class of students out of Clever✅ View Clever login status for students✅ Clever Library Add\nClever Library applications✅  Review Clever Library applications✅ Clever Dashboard permissionsView login metrics for applications\nat school✅Create custom sections✅ Manage application sharing permissions3✅ \n\nNotations: 1Clever Passwords or external (third-party) identity provider passwords if enabled by Clever Admin; 2Only have access\nto Badges for their schools; 3Must be enabled on a per-application basis by a Clever Admin\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER PORTAL: DIFFERENCES FOR STAFF VS.

Some\nexamples include:\n\n * District-wide applications \n * Various Clever Library applications \n * Links to online tools (e.g. Wikipedia.org, Dictionary.com)\n * Homework or assignments in Google Drive\n * Community websites (e.g. local public library)\n * Messaging with students and guardians (if enabled by the district)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNON-TEACHING STAFF PORTAL\n\nThe non-teaching staff Clever Portal has more limited functionality than the Teacher Portal. However, staff do have the ability\nto:\n\n * Single sign-on (SSO) into applications that are shared by the district\n * Find all business applications, resources, and links in one place\n * See district updates on the Portal Announcement board\n * Easily find any resources using the search option"

Instructions to create a dummy user\n4. Extra Credit: Clever Academy\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever makes it easy to access the Portal as an individual student or teacher and see exactly what they see. You can also create\nyour own dummy/fake users if you'd like a sandbox environment.\n\nImpersonating an account or creating a dummy account are great for:\n\n * Troubleshooting issues that users report, so you can see the error code/message, and see what's going on.\n * Learning about the teacher and student Clever Portal experiences.\n * If you're leading a training or demonstration of the Clever Portal and want to walk through the teacher or student experience.\n   This recommendation replaces our previous Demo Account/Demoville feature. \n\n \n\nPlease note: District Administrators who are Clever Admins or District Help Desk roles, and School Tech Leads can use this\ntool. School Tech Leads only have access to Teacher Portals and can't sign in as students.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO IMPERSONATE A REAL USER\n\nThere are two ways that you can use the Access Portal as a feature:\n\n1. Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Data Browser to locate the specific user you would like to impersonate. Select Access\nPortal as user to access the user's portal.\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Using the Clever Dashboard search bar to locate the individual user. From their profile page, select Access Portal as user to\nview their portal.\n\n\nWith either option, on the next screen you will start the portal session. From there, you can access any of their connected\napplications, and use any tools that the user has access to.\n\n\nWhen you’re done, remember to log out of any applications you’ve accessed, and select End Portal Session.\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: The browsers that support this feature are Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. \n\n \nBy the way, if you want School Tech Leads in your district to have the ability to view teacher accounts for training and\ntroubleshooting view this help center article. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE A DUMMY USER\n\nIf you'd like to create a brand-new dummy user, so you can use the account without modifying an actual user's account (like\nbuilding a Teacher Page or sending a message via Clever Messages), you can create a fake teacher or student using Clever's custom\ndata feature. \n\nYou can learn how to create a custom teacher here, and custom a student here. \n\nOnce you've created a dummy teacher or student account, you can log in to the account via the credentials you set when creating\nthe custom teacher/student. Just be sure to use the student login screen (Clever.com/in/your-district-url), and not the District\nAdmin login screen.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEXTRA CREDIT: CLEVER ACADEMY\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Student and Teacher Portal features you can view teacher training content in Clever Academy .\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to Clever support!

This hold prevents\nthe changes from processing until reviewed and approved by a district admin or by Clever.\n\nYou can modify the thresholds that trigger a sync hold to prevent unnecessary holds. To prevent accidental data deletions, we do\nnot allow for disabling delete thresholds completely. Learn more about sync hold thresholds here."

If you notice the\nStaff page of your account looks different from the documentation below, please view this article instead.\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever Admins are able to provide various non-instructional staff (i.e. non-teaching staff) access to Clever. For an overview of\nClever Roles and permissions, please see this article.\n\nClever Tip: If your district uses the Infinite Campus API or Skyward API sync type, skip below to this section for information on\nhow staff are automatically synced to Clever. If your district uses Active Directory, click here  to automatically sync staff data\nto Clever.\n\n\nFor most districts, there are two ways to add staff to Clever: \n\n 1. Staff as part of your normal sync or a one-time sync upload.\n 2. Custom Staff, added individually on a per-user basis.\n\nPlease see the table below to determine the best method for your district. Please note that many districts choose to manage staff\nin bulk using Staff and will manually add individual accounts using Custom Staff as needed.

This method is best\nfor adding staff members in bulk if they are not synced to Clever by the district's student information system (SIS). Please note:\nYou must explicitly share staff users with your learning applications once they have been created in Clever. \n\n 1. From your Clever Dashboard, select Sync > Upload.\n 2. Open the staff.csv and add an additional row for each staff member you would like to add to Clever. If you need an example\n    file, click Download example files.\n\nNote: DO NOT REMOVE any staff users you still want to access  Clever. If you remove a user from the staff.csv before re-uploading\nit their record will be deleted. Rather, add the additional user information to the file before re-uploading.\n 3. Upload your Staff.csv file. When the cloud displays as green, select Upload. The staff updates will be reflected in Clever in\n    about 15 minutes.\n\n\n *  \n\nDistricts that sync data to Clever via SFTP can also upload the staff.csv directly to their district's Clever SFTP folder. For\ninstructions, visit: SFTP: How do I upload my data to Clever?\n \n\nFor additional information about Clever's SFTP and CSV formatting specifications, click here.\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOADING STAFF FOR AUTO SYNC DISTRICTS\n\nIf your district's student information system (SIS) isn't automatically syncing staff members to Clever, you can upload them in\nbulk directly from your Clever Dashboard. You will navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Staff  page and upload a staff.csv\nfile under \"Manual upload.\" Please note: You must explictly share staff users with your learning applications once created in\nClever. \n\n\n1. From your Clever Dashboard, select Sync > Staff.\n2. Open the staff.csv and add an additional row for each staff member you would like to add to Clever. If you need an example\nfile, click \"Download example files.\"\n \nNote: DO NOT REMOVE any staff users you still want to access Clever. Removing a user from the staff.csv before re-uploading it\nwill delete their record. Rather, add the additional user information to the file before re-uploading.\n \n3. Upload your staff.csv file. When the cloud displays as green, select Upload. The staff updates will be reflected in Clever in\nabout 15 minutes.\n \n\n\n \n\nFor additional information about Clever's SFTP and CSV formatting specifications, click here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT UPLOAD TIPS\n\nWhen uploading staff to Clever, there are a few important details to consider:\n \n\n * Each unique staff member requires a unique staff_id. \n    \n * Always include all staff in the staff.csv file if you still want them to have access to Clever. If you remove a user from the\n   staff.csv before re-uploading the file their record will be deleted. \n    \n * The school_id must match the school_id (i.e. sis_id) for a school in Clever. To locate this value, search for the school from\n   the top search bar and select the school to bring up the school's profile page. Under School Information, find the School ID.\n   Use this school_id value in the staff.csv.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n * For staff that are not associated with a specific school or are associated with the district office, use the school_id value:\n   DEFAULT_DISTRICT_OFFICE\n\n * Uploaded staff are auto-assigned the role Portal Access. Portal Access users do not have any administrative rights and can only\n   Single Sign-On (SSO) to applications from their Clever Portal. Applications must first be shared with them by a Clever Admin.\n * For instructions on manually adding individual staff members to Clever via the Custom Data feature, visit: Adding custom staff\n   to Clever\n\n \n\nFor information on admin and staff roles in Clever, please visit: Clever Roles: Overview of Roles & Permissions\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nASSOCIATING STAFF TO MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OR THE DISTRICT OFFICE \n\nMultiple schools:\n \n\nTo associate a staff member with multiple schools, create a separate row at each location. The only field that will be different\nfor each row is the school_id. For example, if a staff member should be associated with three schools, it should look like this:\n\n\n\n\nAll schools:\n \n\nTo associate a staff member with all schools in the district, enter school_id: district\n\n\n\n\nDefault District Office:\n \n\nThere is a default auto-generated district office in Clever. To associate a staff member with the district office, enter the\nschool_id: DEFAULT_DISTRICT_OFFICE\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEDITING & REMOVING STAFF OR UPDATING THEIR ROLES\n\n 1. From your Clever Dashboard, select Sync > Upload.\n 2. Under Download existing files, select staff.csv. The downloaded\n    staff.csv file will contain all pre-existing staff in Clever for your district.\n\n\n 1. Edit the records for staff as desired and save the file.\n     \n 2. Next, upload the file. When the cloud displays as green, select Upload. The staff updates will be reflected in Clever in about\n    15 minutes.\n     \n\n\nTo update a staff member's role from Portal Access to School Tech Lead, please follow the instructions here: Clever Roles: School\nTech Lead.\n \n\nPlease note: You should list all staff members in the staff.csv every time you upload a new file to Clever! The staff member will\nbe deleted from Clever and connected applications if their record is not populated in the staff.csv.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDISTRICTS USING THE INFINITE CAMPUS API OR SKYWARD API SYNC\n\nInfinite Campus API\n \n\nStaff are synced to Clever if:\n \n\n * Teacher is not checked for their district assignment in Infinite Campus.\n\n\nAll staff members that do not have 'Teacher' checked will appear as 'Administrator' in the OneRoster API and will be synced to\nClever as Staff.\n\n\nIf a user has 'Teacher' and another assignment checked. They will be synced to Clever as both a Teacher and Staff. Upon login to\nClever, they can select which user session they wish to access.\n\n\nWe recommend using our manual CSV upload if you prefer greater control over which users sync to Clever as Staff. Contact Clever\nSupport if you want to enable this option for your district. \n\n \n \n\nSkyward API\n \n\nStaff are synced to Clever if both conditions below are true:\n \n\n * \"Teacher = False\" (unchecked)\n * Their 'Title' is either blank or contains one of the following words:\n   * Superintendent\n   * Principal\n   * Instruction\n   * Curriculum\n   * Director\n   * Coordinator\n   * Technology\n   * Coach\n   * Counselor\n   * Admin\n\nOnce staff members have been uploaded to Clever, you must ensure they are shared with the desired applications. For instructions,\nvisit: Sharing Permissions: Sharing staff with applications\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAUTOMATED STAFF SFTP FOR AUTO SYNCS \n\nIf your schools use a Clever-Managed Auto Sync that can’t sync staff (like PowerSchool, Infinite Campus auto, Skyward auto, Aeries\nAPI, and Blackbaud), we have a solution to automate your staff data upload! \nThis feature provides schools with an SFTP directory that can accept a staff.csv file.  Clever will use this staff.csv file as the\nsource of truth, as this file will supersede any SIS-synced staff data. Utilizing your SIS sync or Custom data are preferred\nmethods for syncing staff and you should only use solution if you want to automate staff via SFTP that supersedes your SIS.\n\nTo activate this feature, reach out to our support team. Once activated, you’ll see SFTP credentials on your Sync page under the\nStaff tab or you to use, as shown below. \n\n\n\nOnce you have the SFTP credentials, you can use an FTP client like Filezilla, or WinSCP, to upload your staff.csv file to the\npreferred-sis-data directory in your SFTP box.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you upload your staff.csv file to a directory other than preferred-sis-data, your data will not process, and you\nwill not receive an error message. Please ensure that your staff.csv file is uploaded to the preferred-sis-data directory.\n\n\nPlease note: A staff.csv uploaded to the preferred-sis-data directory will be processed during a sync pause. See this article  to\nlearn more about sync pauses. If you plan to start syncing these staff members using your normal SIS sync after coming off pause,\nensure that the staff_id field in your staff.csv matches the staff_id that will be used by your SIS sync.\n\n\nLearn more about the staff.csv file and how to format it here.\n\nWho does NOT need this feature:\n\n \n\n * If you already have an SFTP directory, you would just need to automate your staff upload to that SFTP directory.\n * If you only want to upload staff manually, you would use custom data."

FAQs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOver the school year, there are a variety of actions for you to take as a Clever Admin to ensure Clever works smoothly for you and\nyour district. \n\n\nTasks help you keep track of everything: from prepping for summer school, to addressing data errors and everything in between.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT ARE TASKS?\n\nTasks highlight opportunities, issues, and errors that need attention, connecting you to resources you need and surfacing new\nfeatures. With tasks, you have one more layer of support to ensure you’re getting the most out of Clever.\n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition to tasks created by Clever, District Curriculum Leads can create a task to remind Clever Admin to accept any pending\napplication invitations.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING TASKS\n\nThink of tasks as your Clever to-do list. They're there to remind you of important actions and other information.\n\nFor example, if there's an issue with your sync, you might see a task suggesting you take action to fix the issue. \n\nOr, if a new feature has launched that might make your life easier, you might see a task encouraging you to check it out. \n\nConsider logging in to Clever regularly to check for any new tasks to keep your Clever account in tip-top shape. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDISMISSING TASKS\n\nIf there’s a task that’s not relevant to you, you can dismiss it by clicking the X to the right of the task. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\nWho else in my district sees tasks?\n\n * All users with the role of Clever Admin see tasks. District Curriculum Lead and District Help Desk users don't see tasks.\n\nDoes a task go away for everyone if I dismiss it?\n\n * No, it only goes away for you!"

This article will walk\nyou through how to review and clean up your team.\n\nTo view your Clever team, navigate to the Team page of the District Dashboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT ARE CLEVER ADMIN USERS?\n\nYour Clever District Team is made up of users with one of the following roles: Clever Admin (Owner), Clever Admin, District\nCurriculum Lead, District Help Desk. To learn more about the admin team roles, see this article.\n\nSchool Tech Leads (STLs) are not admin users. School Tech Leads are staff users that have been given additional permissions in\nClever to allow them to support in troubleshooting for your district. Learn more about School Tech Leads here .\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT CLEVER ADMIN OWNER?\n\nThe Clever Admin Owner has unique privileges and is considered the primary point of contact for all Clever-related issues. See\nthis article to learn more about Clever Admin Owners.\n\nIt is critical that the Clever Admin Owner account is in the possession of the person at your school district who is empowered to\nmake important decisions about your Clever account. If your account owner is no longer employed at your district, you may\nexperience delays when making some district requests.\n\nTo transfer the account owner, see the instructions here.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADMIN USERS AND ROSTERING\n\nBy default, admin users are shared with all rostering applications. Before making any changes to your team, consider whether you\nare using the default admin rostering into any of your connected applications. If you are considering removing team members,\nconsider adding them as staff users to Clever and sharing them with the appropriate applications.\n\nLearn about Customizing District Admin field access here.\n\nLearn about Staff users here.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDO USERS HAVE THE RIGHT ROLE?\n\nWhen reviewing your team, you can edit which role your users have. See this article to Determine the best role for a user.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREMOVING OUTDATED ACCOUNTS\n\nAfter considering whether you are using admin user rostering, consider if there are any admin users that you can remove.\n * Be sure to delete any admin users who are no longer in your district.\n * Be sure to delete any admin users who have moved to a new position where they no longer need their Clever Admin role. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWill deleted admins receive an email notifying them that their account has been deleted? \n\n * No. However, you may choose to reach out to inform your team about updated accounts. \n\n\nI am the Clever account owner and will be leaving my role soon. Do I need to transfer ownership before I leave? \n\n * It is best practice for a seamless transition to transfer the Clever account ownership before you leave while you still have\n   access to the Clever account as the account owner.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles:\n * Clever Roles: Overview of Roles & Permissions\n * Clever Roles: Clever Admin\n * Clever Roles: Staff - How to add to Clever"

When troubleshooting, this can help STLs diagnose an issue, retrieve an error code or message, or gain visibility into what\nmight be confusing. This is overall a great way to empower more folks in your district to support teachers with their technical\nrequests. \n \n\nThis tool enables STLs to view a portal as a teacher in their scoped school.

We recommend communicating this\nupdate to them so they have the opportunity to take advantage of this tool while supporting teachers and students.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUSING THE \"ACCESS PORTAL AS\" FEATURE\n\nAfter you’ve turned on this tool for the STLs in your district, they will start seeing the button to Access Portal as user on\nteacher profiles.\n \n\n\n\n\nUpon clicking this option, STLs will first need to offer a reason for accessing the Clever Portal as this particular user. Next,\nthe STL will need to confirm that they understand teacher profiles may contain sensitive user information. Only then can they\nproceed to Begin Portal Session. \n \n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: As an additional transparency measure, the teacher whose portal is being accessed, will receive an automatic email\nfrom Clever with the message that the STL included"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Auto Syncs\n3. SFTP Syncs\n3. Changing Syncs\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThink of Clever Secure Sync as a bridge between your Student Information System (SIS) and online learning applications. Secure\nSync maintains up-to-date roster information in your learning applications by securely transferring your roster uploads or\nconnecting directly with your SIS. Clever is engineered to be the most secure and convenient way for districts to send vendors\ndata and grant access to learning applications.\n\nThe Secure Sync process can be summarized in four steps:\n\n 1. Your school district’s data syncs to your Clever account through an Auto Sync or an SFTP sync.\n 2. Sharing permissions with each connected application are set up to determine which data to share with that application.\n 3. Applications pull all available data from your Clever account, typically on a nightly basis.\n 4. Student, teacher, and staff accounts are automatically created in the applications. From that point on, applications regularly\n    update any changes to your enrollment information as indicated in your Clever account. \n\nContinue reading to learn about Clever’s different sync types. With all Clever sync types, the school district has complete\ncontrol over data access and management of the Clever account. \n\nPlease note: Clever can only connect to one student information system (SIS) per district account. If your district uses more than\none SIS, you will need to set up more than one Clever account. \n\n\n\nAUTO SYNCS\n\nAn Auto Sync with Clever involves basic initial setup and requires minimal IT support from your district because Clever syncs\ndirectly with your SIS to securely transfer student roster data. There are two types of Auto Syncs: Clever-Managed and SIS-Managed\nAuto Syncs. Curious if Clever offers an automated sync with your SIS? Check out this article.\n\n\n\nSFTP SYNCS\n\nThis option allows school districts to “push” data to Clever. Districts generate multiple files in a Clever-specific CSV format\nand submit them to Clever using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The SFTP sync allows districts to upload data using an FTP\nclient or Clever’s Web Upload tool. Districts control exactly what data to include in their upload files, therefore this option\nprovides districts a greater level of customization but requires more robust setup and management. Clever also recommends\nautomating the process of exporting data from your SIS and uploading it to Clever. For more information on SFTP syncs, read this\narticle.\n \n\n\n CHANGING SYNCS\n\nMoving to a new student information system (SIS)? No worries—Clever has you covered! Clever can assist in keeping your downstream\napplication data clean and ready-to-go. For more information on what this process of changing syncs will entail, read this\narticle.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about Secure Sync, please reach out to Clever Support! We are happy to help!"

Sync holds are a safeguard to avoid potentially incorrect or undesired changes from being processed and synced to connected\napplications. These holds are essential to the sync process as they ensure that Clever Admins are aware of potentially significant\nchanges to their Clever data. Without holds, a district could experience unintended changes to data, which could negatively impact\nusers and connected applications.  \n \n\nPlease note: Significant changes to custom data can also trigger a hold. Holds are not limited to only your synced data.\n\n\nAs shown below, when a sync is on hold, Clever Admins can select the Review Hold option under the sync hold alert or can review\nthe information from their Clever Dashboard > Sync page before accepting or declining the changes. An email will also be sent to\nthe district's Clever Admins who have their Sync emails enabled.\n\n\n\n \n\nIf the deletions for schools, students, teachers, or staff exceed 95%, and the Clever Admin chooses to accept the changes, a\nClever support ticket will be automatically created to be reviewed by a Clever Support agent. Support cases are not automatically\ncreated for the following record types: sections, contacts, and terms.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nDEFAULT HOLD THRESHOLDS\n\nA district's data automatically goes on hold when at least 75% of any data type (e.g. schools, students, teachers, sections) is\nbeing updated, or over 10% is being deleted. These thresholds can be customized.\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nCUSTOM HOLD THRESHOLDS\n\nClever Admins can set custom hold thresholds for all record types (e.g. schools, students, teachers, sections) on the Sync >\nSettings page.\n\nSetting hold thresholds can be helpful for:\n\n * Small districts where small changes in data may represent large percentage changes\n * Clever Admins that plan to make large updates and want to avoid a hold for known changes\n\nClever Admins can determine the percentage threshold for both updates and deletions for each record type. The following ranges are\nallowed:\n\n * Updates\n   * 0 - 100% - Schools, Students, Sections, Teachers, Contacts, Terms\n * Deletions\n   * 0 - 90% - Schools, Students, Sections, Teachers, Contacts\n   * 0 - 100% - Terms\n\nIf desired, holds for updates may be disabled. Holds for deletions may not be disabled and have a max threshold of 90%.\n\nExample view of custom hold thresholds:\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNC REPORTS\n\nClever Admins can review their sync reports from the Clever Dashboard > Sync page. The report consists of a table summarizing the\ndata changes that triggered the sync hold. These changes will not be processed in Clever until they have been approved by a Clever\nAdmin.\n\nSelect Download Changes to view updates, deletions, warnings, and errors for each record type.  \n\n             \n\n\n\nIF THE SYNC CHANGES LOOK GOOD\n\nGreat! Select Approve Changes.\n\n * If the changes are less than 95% deletions, Clever will immediately begin processing the new data.\n * If the changes are more than 95% deletions or updates for any record type, a support case will be generated with Clever Support\n   for final review. This is an extra safeguard for districts to ensure there is no negative effect on students, teachers, and\n   applications. Please include a message noting why significant changes are being made -- Clever Support will use this\n   information to review the hold. If everything looks correct, the team will release the hold. If any concerns arise, they will\n   contact you via email. \n\n \n\n\nIF THE SYNC CHANGES LOOK INCORRECT\n\nNo problem! If the changes were not intentional, please follow these steps:\n\nFor SFTP syncs:\n\n * Select 'Discard Changes'.\n * Depending on your district's sync type, you will: \n   * SFTP syncs: Review and correct the CSV file(s) that triggered the hold, and then re-upload your CSV files to Clever via your\n     SIS, or via the Sync > Upload page.\n   * SIS-managed SFTP syncs: Clever has little insight into how data is filtered and exported from a district's SIS, so we are not\n     able to help troubleshoot beyond looking at the files we receive. If you are unable to determine why the data changes were\n     incorrect, please reach out to your SIS rep to see if they can investigate the issue on their end.\n * Submit another upload: If the revised data matches your existing data in Clever closely enough, the new upload will override\n   the hold, and the changes will process automatically.\n\nFor Auto Syncs:\n\n * Select Discard Changes.\n * Review the data in your SIS to see if you can determine why the synced data is changing so significantly.  It may be necessary\n   to loop in your SIS rep for assistance. \n * Once the issues have been addressed in your SIS, you should be able to initiate a sync to Clever using the Sync Now option on\n   the Sync > Settings page.\n * If the revised data matches your existing data in Clever closely enough, the new upload will override the hold, and the changes\n   will process automatically.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSCHOOL YEAR AND TERM ROLLOVERS \n\nWhen a school year or term rolls over, the sync updates from your district's SIS will typically trigger a sync hold, which is\nexpected! In most cases, the rollover changes will contain significant updates to the rostering data in Clever. Here are some\nchanges that would be expected:\n\n * Sections: 100% deleted, 100% created\n * Students: 100% updated, 10-25% deleted, 10-25% created\n * Teachers: 10-20% deleted, 10-20% created\n\nIf you're not sure about the hold, navigate to the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard. From there, you can select the Download\nChanges for each record type. This will download a .zip file which includes the creations, updates, deletions, warnings and errors\nfor the related record type.\n\n           \n\nFor detailed information regarding school year and term rollovers, please visit:\n\n * School Year Rollover: Overview, Preparation & Recommendations\n * Term Rollover: Overview, Preparation & Recommendations"

Modifying a scheduled pause\n6. Removing a pause\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever allows districts to pause the sync from their student information system (SIS). When a sync is paused, the current\nrostering data is essentially \"frozen\" in Clever for the duration of the district's sync pause.   \n\nIMPORTANT \nFor 2024, Clever automatically pauses syncs on May 31 and removes pauses between July 29 and August 2 unless you specify\notherwise. You can modify these dates (or remove them altogether) under your Sync > Sync Settings page.\n\n\nThe two primary use cases for pausing data are school year rollover, and planning for summer school. Please see the following\narticles for details:\n\n * School Year Rollover: Overview, Preparation & Recommendations\n * Summer School: Sync settings\n\n \n\nPlease note: If you want to pause syncing your data to a particular application, please see this article: For Clever Admins:\nPausing your sync for a specific app.  This is a perfect tool for semester rollover and summer school, but shouldn't be confused\nwith an SIS sync pause.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHEN A DISTRICT'S SYNC IS PAUSED\n\nWhen your district's SIS sync to Clever is paused:\n\n * Rosters will not sync from your SIS to Clever: SFTP uploads will not be processed, and automatic syncs will not run (this means\n   that changes made in your SIS will not interrupt student and teacher access to applications)\n * Applications may still sync rosters from Clever, allowing them to sync records updated via custom data. If you'd like your\n   application(s) to stop pulling data from Clever, please reach out to the application partner directly to learn more about the\n   options available.\n * You can continue to update sharing permissions with applications\n * Your sync status will appear as “Paused” in your Clever Dashboard\n * All team members on the account will receive an email notification the day before the pause begins\n * All team members in your Clever Dashboard > Team page will receive an email notification the day before the pause ends.\n\n      \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHEN A DISTRICT SYNC PAUSE ENDS OR IS CANCELED\n\nWhen a district's sync pause ends or is canceled: \n\n * Clever will resume syncing with your SIS (auto-syncs), or process your next upload (SFTP syncs)\n * If your data has changed significantly, your account will go on hold\n * You can confirm that your account is syncing correctly by checking the sync status on your Dashboard\n * All team members on the account will receive an email reminder on the last day of the pause\n\n             \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSCHEDULING OR INITIATING A PAUSE\n\nA sync pause can be initiated or canceled by a district admin from the Sync > Settings page by entering pause start and end dates.\n\n\n\nPause Dates\n\n * Pause Start Date: This will be the first day your sync goes on pause.\n * Pause End Date: This will be the last day your sync is paused.\n\nTo schedule an indefinite pause:\n * Enter a Pause Start Date\n * Leave Pause End Date blank\n * Select Update\n * To begin syncing again, select Clear at any time.\n\n\nSync pauses run from 12:00 AM on the pause start date to 11:59 PM on the pause end date, local time.\n \n\n☀️ Summer Pause: Clever recommends the following dates when pausing your sync:\n\nPause Start Date: the last day of the spring term. This will ensure data from the normal school year is not deleted. \n\nPause End Date: the day before you want to resume syncing data. For example, if you wish to resume syncing with your sis on August\n1st, set the Pause End Date to July 31. \n\n  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMODIFYING A SCHEDULED PAUSE\n\nTo modify a sync pause that has already been scheduled, navigate to your Sync Settings page:\n\n * Click within the box next to Pause Start Date or Pause End Date.\n * Select the desired date(s).\n * Select Update to confirm the change.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREMOVING A PAUSE\n\nTo remove a sync pause and resume syncing data to Clever at any time, navigate to Sync > Settings. Under Schedule Sync\nPause, click Clear."

Not all applications support extension fields. \n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIf your district would like to send data fields outside of the standard fields listed in our Data Specifications, you can do so by\nuploading custom/extension fields either directly through your Clever Dashboard, or through your district's existing sync.\n\nDistrict admins have the ability to add custom fields for the following data types:\n\n * Schools\n * Sections\n * Students\n * Teachers\n * Staff\n\nOur system does not accept custom fields for enrollments or student contacts at this time.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOADING CUSTOM FIELDS TO CLEVER\n\nCustom fields can be uploaded through the Clever Dashboard by navigating to Support tools > Custom data . Select Add custom data >\nFields. A window will pop up allowing you to upload a CSV file for each data type that you would like to create custom fields\nfor.  When you upload custom extension data, it will take about 15 minutes for the new data to sync to Clever. The sync may also\ngo on hold due to large changes in data. Click here to read more about holds and how to resolve them.\n\nPlease note: If your district already syncs the same custom field through your SIS sync or another custom data sync, those values\nwill take precedence over this custom field upload. \n\n\n      \n\n\n\nThe CSV format is the same for students, teachers, schools, and sections:\nsis_id, {custom fields}\n\nsis_id, {custom fields}\n\n\nThe CSV format for staff is:\n\nstaff_id, {custom fields}\n\n\nCustom fields columns must be prefixed with 'ext.'\n\n * For example, a custom field named 'nickname' should be labeled 'ext.nickname'. Please refer to the example below for students:\n\n\n             \n\n * Extension headers may only contain one period. For example, a file with 'ext.favorite.food' will not process (ext.favorite_food\n   is valid).  \n\nPlease note: Extension field files that are uploaded directly to a district’s SFTP folder must be named with all lowercase letters\n(e.g., schools_ext.csv, students_ext.csv, etc.).  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOADING CUSTOM FIELDS VIA YOUR DISTRICT'S SIS SYNC\n\n \n\n Extension fields cannot be added to the Infinite Campus API or OneRoster syncs. To add extension fields, please upload the\nextension field data directly in the Clever as outlined here.\n\n \n\nSFTP and SIS-Managed Auto Syncs:\n\nThere are a couple of options for uploading custom field data to Clever via SFTP/CSV files:\n\n * Districts can add a custom/extension field column to one of the existing rostering files being synced to Clever (schools.csv,\n   teachers.csv, students.csv, sections.csv, and enrollments.csv). The column name must begin with 'ext'.\n   * For example: Fields such as 'Program Code' or 'Gifted Status' could be added to the students.csv with columns named\n     'ext.program_code' or 'ext.gifted_status' to your CSV files.\n   * Don't create an extension field with a space in the name. For example, a name like ext.iep status can fail, so you'd want to\n     use ext.iep_status.\n\n * If your district only syncs data to Clever via SFTP, you can also upload custom fields via CSV files directly to your Clever\n   SFTP folder by uploading to a subdirectory named /extensionfields. The files should be named:\n   * schools_ext.csv\n   * sections_ext.csv\n   * students_ext.csv\n   * teachers_ext.csv\n   * staff_ext.csv\n\n \n\n   For information about uploading data via SFTP, please visit: SFTP Syncs: Uploading data to Clever\n\n  \n\nFor the following auto-syncs, custom fields can be added by reaching out to Clever support to help set up custom field mapping!\n\n * PowerSchool\n * Infinite Campus Auto Sync\n * Skyward Auto Sync\n * Illuminate Auto Sync\n * Aeries Auto Sync\n * SchoolInsight Auto Sync\n * iNow Auto Sync\n * Skyward API sync\n * Blackbaud API sync\n * Infinite Campus API sync\n\nPlease reach out to Clever Support and we can get this started for you.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVIEWING AND MANAGING CUSTOM FIELD DATA IN CLEVER\n\nYou can take a look at your most recently uploaded custom fields by navigating to Support tools > Custom data > Reports. Here, you\ncan view details about the record type, the fields that were added, and the time of the last update. This page also includes an\nerror report detailing any errors in the files. You can also download your district's current custom field files.\n \n\n\n\nCustom field data for each particular record type can be viewed in your Clever Dashboard by navigating to Data Browser.

Contact types\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nStudent contacts are typically parents, family, guardians or close friends of students who can be contacted by the school or\ndistrict in the event of an emergency or other important communication need. Clever supports multiple contacts for each student.\nOnce in Clever, this data can be synced to your district's connected applications. \n\nTo review student contact data in Clever, district admins can navigate to the Clever Dashboard > Data Browser > Contacts tab.\n\n \n\n Clever released an update to enhance data quality for student contacts and we now refer to them as \"Contacts\". However, there are\nstill some applications that have not updated to our newest version, so we continue to keep both the \"Student Contacts\" and\n\"Contacts\" tabs visible in the Data Browser. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNCING STUDENT CONTACTS TO CLEVER\n\nDepending on if your district is syncing rostering data to Clever via a Clever-managed auto sync, SIS-Managed auto sync, or SFTP\nsync, student contact data will vary.  This section details the requirements and processes for the different sync types.\n\n \n\n\nSFTP AND SIS-MANAGED SFTP SYNCS\n\nFor SFTP syncs and SIS-managed SFTP syncs, the following seven fields (i.e. columns) can be added to the students.csv upload to\nClever:  \n\nRequired fields:\n * Contact_type (required):  Primary, Secondary, Parent/Guardian, Emergency, Family, Other. \n * Contact_name (required):  The name of the contact. \n\nOptional:\n * Contact_sis_id: The unique identifier for the contact\n * Contact_relationship: Parent, Grandparent, Self, Aunt/Uncle, Sibling, Other\n * Contact_phone: 10- or 11-digit phone number without any characters (e.g. parentheses, dashes)\n * Contact_phone_type: Cell, Home, Work, Other\n * Contact_email: Contact email address in the standard email format of username@demo.com \n\n\n\nMULTIPLE STUDENT CONTACTS:\n\n * For students with multiple contacts, create multiple rows for the student; one for each contact. \n * Each row will contain the identical student details (e.g. student_id, student_number, etc.), but will have different contact\n   information on each row.  \n\n\n \n\nClever Tip: There is no limit to the number of student contacts that can be synced to Clever via an SFTP sync!\n\n \n\n\nCLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS\n\nThese are the required and optional fields for syncing student contacts to Clever:\n\nRequired:\n\n * Contact_type (required):  Primary, Secondary, Parent/Guardian, Emergency, Family, Other. \n * Contact_name (required):  The name of the contact.\n\nOptional:\n\n * Contact_relationship: Parent, Grandparent, Self, Aunt/Uncle, Sibling, Other\n * Contact_phone: 10- or 11-digit phone number without any characters (e.g. parentheses, dashes)\n * Contact_phone_type: Cell, Home, Work, Other\n * Contact_email: Contact email address in the standard email format of username@demo.com \n\n Find your Clever-Managed Auto Sync below for instructions specific to your SIS!\n\n\n\n\nAERIES\n\nWe pull all contacts associated with a student from the following fields on the Student endpoints of the Aeries API:\n\n * CON.FN + CON.LN\n * CON.EM\n * CON.CP\n * CON.RL\n * CON.OR\n\n\n\nINFINITE CAMPUS AUTO SYNC\n\nStudents can have many (up to 6-7) contacts in Infinite Campus. Clever pulls from these fields:\n\n * contacts.email\n * contacts.homePhone\n * contacts.householdPhone\n * contacts.workPhone\n * contacts.cellPhone\n * contacts.firstName\n * contacts.lastName\n * contacts.householdName\n * contacts.relationship\n\nIf you would like for us to customize the Infinite Campus field that we pull from, please see the instructions for requesting a\ncustom mapping in the Customization section of the Infinite Campus Help Center article. \n\n\n\nINFINITE CAMPUS API SYNC\n\nBy default, the Infinite Campus API sync pulls student contacts from the following fields:\n\n Clever Field\n\n  Infinite Campus Field\n\n Contact_name \n\n identity.firstName + identity.lastName\n\n Contact_type\n\n This is flagged within IC: Guardian/Relative = Census >  Relationships\n\n Contact_phone \n\n contact.homePhone\n\n Contact_email\n\n contact.email\n\nCustomization of the IC API sync is not available at this time. \n\n\n\n\nILLUMINATE\n\nIf you have questions about student contact data for your Illuminate Auto Sync, please reach out to our support team for more\ninformation.\n \n\n\n\nPOWERSCHOOL\n\nBy default, Clever pulls student contact info from the following fields in PowerSchool:\n\n * Emerg Contact 1\n * Emerg Contact 2\n * Emerg Contact 3\n * Emerg Phone 1\n * Emerg Phone 2\n * Emerg Phone 3\n * Emerg 1 Ptype\n * Emerg 2 Ptype\n * Emerg 3 Ptype\n * Emerg 1 Rel\n * Emerg 2 Rel\n * Emerg 3 Rel\n\nThe PowerSchool Auto Sync can be customized so that Clever pulls student contacts from different fields than those listed above.\nVisit our PowerSchool Help Center article for instructions on requesting a custom mapping!\n \n\n\n\nSCHOOLINSIGHT\n\nIf you have questions about student contact data for your SchoolInsight Auto Sync, please reach out to our support team for more\ninformation. \n \n\n\n\nSKYWARD AUTO SYNC\n\nClever pulls eight fields for Skyward emergency contact, forming cohesive student contacts in Clever:\n\n * E1_Full_Name\n * E1_Relation_Dsc\n * E1_Cell_Phone\n * E1_Pri_Phone\n * E1_Street_Addr\n * E1_City\n * E1_State\n * E1_Zip_Code\n\nIt is not possible to have more than one contact record per student. However, we can customize the sync to pull from other fields\ninstead.\n\n * For example: If you want to use Parent_Name and Parent_Phone instead of E1 Full Name and E1 Cell Phone, we can do that!\n\n \n\n\n\nSKYWARD API SYNC\n\nClever syncs student contacts from the guardian endpoint and pulls multiple contacts per student. We can customize the Auto Sync\nto pull student contact information from different fields, as long as those fields are accessible via Skyward’s API. Contact\nClever support for more information!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nDUPLICATE CONTACTS\n\nOur system will attempt to merge contacts to prevent duplicate contacts in your Clever data. The best way to prevent duplicate\ncontacts is to sync contact_sis_id for each contact. \n\nIf a contact_sis_id is not available, Clever will attempt to merge contacts in the following logic:\n * If contact_email is available, we will merge contacts by matching on: contact_name + contact_email\n * If email is not available and contact_phone is available, we will merge contacts by matching on: contact_name + contact_phone\n * If neither contact_email or contact_phone are available, we will try to merge contacts by matching on student_id + contact_name\n   + contact_type + contact_relationship + contact_phone_type\n\nThe above logic relies on exact alphanumeric matches, including case sensitivity. For example, Clever will not match \"John Doe\"\nand \"john doe\". \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCONTACT TYPES\n\nWhen Clever normalizes your contact data, we look to the following keywords to match to Parent/Guardian, Emergency, Primary,\nSecondary, Family, and Other in Clever:\n\nContact TypeAccepted keywords Parent/Guardian\n * guardian\n * mother\n * father\n * parent\n * mom\n * dad\n * stepmother\n * stepfather\n * stepparent\n\n Emergency\n * emergency\n\n Primary\n * primary\n\n Secondary\n * secondary\n\n Family\n * family\n * aunt\n * uncle\n * relative\n * grandmother\n * grandfather\n * grandparent\n * sibling\n\n Other\n * other\n\n\nIf Clever is unable to match a keyword to a contact type, that contact type will be blank in Clever."

Clever can assist in keeping\nyour downstream application data clean and ready-to-go. When you use Clever as your rostering & SSO platform and migrate to a new\nSIS, we can work with you to significantly reduce the risks of creating duplicate student or staff accounts or data errors in the\napplications in which your district has invested.\n\nThis process is a partnership and we are here to ensure you are successful! Since there are multiple steps involved, we recommend\nplanning ahead and starting the process as early as possible to ensure minimal disruption to your students and teachers. \n\nPlease note, to prevent disruption to users, Clever does not recommend completing this transition mid-year. When possible, summer\nrecess is the best time to work through this process.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nPROCESS\n\n 1. Identify how you will sync data to Clever\n    Clever provides districts with multiple methods to sync your data. If your district is transitioning to one of the SISs listed\n    here, you may be able to use Auto Sync to send data to Clever. Using a SIS not listed? No worries - our SFTP sync is a great\n    option. Learn more about syncing data via SFTP here.\n     \n 2. Confirm the primary identifiers for records\n    Clever highly recommends keeping the primary identifier (student_id, teacher_id) the same when transitioning SISs. This will\n    protect you from duplicate or lost records. If your sis_ids are changing, Clever can complete a matching process to preserve\n    as much historical data as possible. You can learn more about the process for changing SIS IDs here.\n     \n 3. Populate data in your new SIS\n    To complete the transition in Clever, you will need to have active data in your new SIS. We recommend having data ready to go\n    3-4 weeks prior to your \"Go Live\" date. \n     \n 4. Contact Clever Support \n    Once data is ready in your SIS, contact Clever support and let us know the name of your SIS and your preferred method of\n    syncing (Auto Sync, SFTP, OneRoster, etc.) We will consult with you to ensure your account is set up for success! \n     \n 5. Configure your Auto Sync or SFTP files\n    Before Clever can complete the migration, we will need to have a successful data connection. If you have chosen an Auto Sync,\n    work with our support team or your SIS provider as appropriate to set up the data sync. Setup directions for Clever-managed\n    Auto Syncs are linked here.\n    \n    If you will be syncing via SFTP, configure files using the directions found here. Please allow up to 1 week to troubleshoot\n    getting your sync or SFTP files successfully configured. \n\n 6. Migrate data\n    Contact Clever Support and let us know when you are ready to upload your first set of data from your new SIS. We will enable\n    protection settings for your account to ensure your teacher and students are minimally affected by the changes in data. During\n    this time, all data syncing between the district, Clever, and connected applications will be paused, however, users will still\n    be able to access Clever and their applications.\n    \n    Once the safety settings are applied, we will have you sync your first set of data to Clever! If the data looks good we will\n    complete a matching process to preserve historical data where possible. Please allow up to 2 weeks for the matching process to\n    be completed.\n    \n    During this time your account may appear with a sync status of \"On Hold\" or \"System Maintenance In Progress\". This is normal\n    and will be resolved once Clever Support has finished the migration process. \n     \n 7. Confirm data changes, sync with apps\n    The final step of the process is to approve the data changes. Since you are moving to a new SIS, there are likely large\n    changes to your data and the sync will be placed on hold pending your approval. Review the data on your Sync page and confirm\n    or discard the changes as appropriate. More details on Sync Holds can be found here. \n    \n    Once the data is live in Clever, please allow up to 24 hrs for the updated data to be reflected in your connected\n    applications. Application partners manage pulling data from Clever and processing it into their system. If you have any\n    questions about the effect of data changes in an application, please contact the application's support team. They will be\n    happy to assist!\n\nReady to get started or have a question? Contact our Support Team. \n\n\ntags: sync conversions"

The Sync or SIS ID Conversion Process\n5. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will go over what a Sync or SIS (Student Information System) ID conversion is, what it entails, and how your school\nor district can prepare if you are planning on going through one! \n\nPlease note: Sync or SIS ID conversions can take up to two or three weeks to complete.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS A SYNC OR SIS ID CONVERSION AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?\n\nA Sync Conversion is needed when schools change their way of syncing data to Clever. This includes changing SIS providers or\nchanging sync types (e.g. going from a manual SFTP sync to a Clever-managed auto sync). A SIS ID Conversion is needed when schools\nplan to change the current school_ids, student_ids, teacher_ids and/or staff_ids in Clever. This process is necessary to preserve\ncurrent Clever records and historical data in app connections as much as possible.\n\nIn most cases, a sync conversion and SIS ID conversion are both needed to ensure a smooth transition. However, if your SIS\nprovider and sync type remain the same, only an SIS ID conversion is needed. The Clever team will work with you to come up with\nthe best plan of action!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSYNC CONVERSION REQUIREMENTS + PREWORK\n\nTo get the ball rolling, there are a few requirements that must be met before initiating a sync or SIS ID conversion with Clever,\nwhich includes:\n\n 1. All users who will require access to Clever (current + new users) should be populated in the SIS.\n 2. All rosters for the calendar year have to be populated in the SIS. However, if your rosters are not finalized, we can start\n    the sync conversion as long as there’s at least 1 active section/enrollment available in the SIS.\n\nWe also recommend completing the following prework to prepare for the sync conversion. This will ensure that there are no hiccups\nin the process and that we’re hitting all of our milestones efficiently and effectively!\n\n 1. Identify how you will sync data to Clever: Clever provides districts with multiple methods to sync your data. If your district\n    is transitioning to one of the SISs listed here, you may be able to use Auto Sync to send data to Clever. Using a SIS not\n    listed? No worries - our SFTP sync is a great option. Learn more about syncing data via SFTP here. \n 2. Confirm the primary identifiers for records: Clever highly recommends keeping the primary identifier (student_id, teacher_id)\n    the same when transitioning SISs. This will protect you from duplicate or lost records. However, if your SIS IDs are changing,\n    Clever can complete a matching process to preserve the current Clever records, as well as historical data in app connections.\n 3. Clear duplicate teacher or student accounts. Duplicate records often occur in the Clever sync if a user has multiple records\n     in the SIS for each school site that they are assigned to, and this can cause issues with the district’s data in Clever and\n    connected applications. Potential issues that can occur include, Clever login issues, rostering issues and/or potential loss\n    of historical data in app connections. To avoid this, we encourage districts to consolidate any potential duplicate records in\n    the SIS if possible before starting a sync conversion.\n 4. Confirm that SIS IDs are not being reused. Clever treats SIS IDs as unique identifiers and uses them to generate Clever IDs,\n    which many of our app partners use to preserve historical data in the app platform. As such, to avoid data issues in Clever\n    and connected applications, you want to avoid any SIS ID reuse within 300 days of when the SIS ID last synced with Clever. In\n    some cases, SIS IDs are recycled in the SIS automatically and districts are unaware of this change until a data error occurs\n    in Clever or a connected app (e.g. incorrect Teacher Page, login issues to Clever, rostering issues in apps, and loss of\n    historical data). To avoid this, we recommend reaching out to your SIS admin to confirm if there’s a potential of SIS IDs\n    being reused and work with your team to ensure each record has a unique identifier that has not synced with Clever in the past\n    300 days.\n 5. Populate data in your new SIS. In order to complete the transition in Clever, you will need to have active data in your new\n    SIS. We recommend having data ready to go 3-4 weeks prior to your \"Go Live\" date.\n 6. Proactively start notifying SSO, Rostering apps: The most critical part of the sync conversion process is the app notification\n    piece, and this can take up the brunt of the sync conversion time frame. Our team will notify some applications, specifically\n    SSO/Rostering apps that use the Clever ID or SIS ID to preserve historical data in the application's platform. However, most\n    of our app partners prefer to work with districts directly during this transition. As such, we recommend proactively reaching\n    out to your SSO, Rostering application in Clever to give them a heads up, so the app can make any necessary changes on their\n    end to ingest the new data! Here is a Help Center article regarding this step, For Clever Admins: Pause your sync for a\n    specific app.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE SYNC OR SIS ID CONVERSION PROCESS\n\n 1. Reach out to Clever: If you plan to switch SIS providers,  +  sync type, and/or SIS IDs for schools, students, teachers, or\n    staff, please reach out to Clever Support before you actually sync the updated data. A specialist will work with you to ensure\n    that your data continues to sync seamlessly with Clever and connected applications.\n 2. Configure your Auto Sync or SFTP files: Before Clever can complete the migration, we will need to have a successful data\n    connection. If you have chosen an Auto Sync, work with our support team or your SIS provider as appropriate to set up the data\n    sync. Setup directions for Clever-managed Auto Syncs are linked here. If you will be syncing via SFTP, configure files using\n    the directions found here. Please allow up to 1 week to troubleshoot getting your sync or SFTP files successfully configured. \n 3. Migrate data: Contact Clever Support and let us know when you are ready to upload your first set of data from your new SIS. We\n    will enable protection settings for your account to ensure your teacher and students are minimally affected by the changes in\n    data. During this time period, all syncing of data between the district, Clever, and connected applications will be paused,\n    however, users will still be able to access Clever and their applications. Current users will still be able to access Clever\n    and their applications but new users will not have access until the sync conversion is completed.\n\n 4. Confirm data changes, sync with apps: The final step of the process is to approve the data changes. Since you are moving to a\n    new SIS, there are likely large changes to your data and the sync will be placed on hold pending your approval. Review the\n    data on your Sync page and confirm or discard the changes as appropriate. More details on Holds can be found here. Once the\n    data is live in Clever, please allow up to 48 hrs for the updated data to be reflected in your connected applications.\n    Application partners manage pulling data from Clever and processing it into their system. If you have any questions about the\n    effect of data changes in an application, please reach out to the application's support team. They will be happy to assist!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n * Can this be done during a sync pause? \n   * Yes, in fact, this is recommended.\n     \n     \n * Why does the sync conversion take up to two weeks? \n   * Many factors can go into how long the conversion takes, such as setup issues, sync errors, waiting on responses from app\n     notifications, volume during peak Back to School, duplicate user accounts, and reused SIS IDs.\n     \n     \n * When should I reach out to start this process?\n   * We suggest you reach out about 3 weeks before you want this completed.\n     \n     \n * Can I only change the SIS ID of one user?\n   \n   * Not at this time. Our internal tools only works for large amounts of SIS ID changes (i.e. 100 IDs or more).\n\n * What are some Clever-managed sync options districts can switch over to?\n   \n   * Clever offers two types of \"Managed Auto Syncs\" that districts can utilize to securely sync (i.e., transfer) rostering data\n     from the district's student information system (SIS) to Clever. Clever Admins can then selectively share specific data with\n     their district's connected learning applications. This article will detail the types of Managed Auto Syncs that Clever\n     offers.\n\n * Who do I reach out to when doing a sync conversion?\n   * Contact our Support Team.\n\n * Is there an option to receive personalized support during my sync conversion with a dedicated specialist?\n   * The sync conversion process is a collaborative effort involving the district, Clever, and connected applications to achieve a\n     smooth transition. While our sync conversion team is committed to helping you meet your goals, opting for our professional\n     services can provide additional consultation and support to further streamline the process. To learn more about this awesome\n     service, check out our sync conversion consulting services.\n\n * Are section IDs preserved during sync conversions?\n   \n   * Our migrating tool is not configured to preserve section IDs, as it is expected that section IDs will change during a sync\n     conversion. However, if section IDs need to be preserved for an app connection, you can speak with the Clever team to discuss\n     potential options.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated Resources:\n\n * Secure Sync: Changing Student Information Systems\n * Secure Sync: Changing SIS IDs"

FAQ\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSome applications require student contact data that may not be stored in your district's student information system (SIS). If your\ndistrict does not store student contact data in your SIS, or would like to add additional student contacts outside of your Clever\nsync, you can now upload student contacts to Clever using a contacts.csv file. Student contacts can be uploaded via the web\nbrowser or via SFTP transfer!\n\n \n\nIMPORTANT Please make sure that contact IDs are never re-used. Clever treats contact IDs as a unique identifier and use it to\ngenerate Clever IDs. Likewise, failure to do so may result in security issues.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nFORMATTING YOUR CSV FILE\n\nTo manually upload student contact data to Clever, you will first need to populate a contacts.csv file containing information\npertinent to your student contacts. Please click here to download a sample contacts.csv template that can be populated with the\ndistrict's student contact data using the guidelines shown below.\n\n\n File Name: contacts.csv\n\nField\n\nRequired\n\nFormat\n\nDescription\n\ncontact_idYStringUnique identifier for the contactstudent_idYStringStudent’s sis_id, so Clever can tie the contact to associated\nstudents. Must be valid Student ID of an existing student and match the value Student ID on the student profile: \n\nfirst_nameYStringContact’s first namelast_nameYStringContact’s last nametypeYStringType of contact - e.g. “family”, “emergency”,\nor “guardian”relationshipNStringContact’s relationship to student - e.g. “Father”, “Aunt”, or “Neighbor”phoneNIntegerA 10 or 11\ndigit phone numberphone_typeNOptionType of phone contact. Supported values: Cell, Home, Work.emailNEmailContact’s email address.\nMust match format x@y.z\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW TO UPLOAD YOUR CSV FILE\n\n\nWEB UPLOAD\n\nYou can upload your contacts.csv file from the Custom Data tab.\n\n\n\nOnce uploaded, you will see the following status message:\n\n\n\nPlease note: Please allow 10-15 minutes for custom data to process. Though Clever will not send an email notification that the\ndata has been processed, the results will be viewable on the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard.  \n\n \n\n\n\nSFTP UPLOAD (NOT AVAILABLE FOR CLEVER-MANAGED SYNC TYPES)\n\nIf you prefer to upload your contact data via SFTP:\n\n 1. Connect to your Clever SFTP directory using the credentials found on your Sync Settings page under SFTP Settings.\n 2. Create a directory called: customcontacts:\n    \n 3. Add the contacts.csv file to the customcontacts directory.\n\nThe file will be processed by Clever in 10-15 minutes. \n\n\n\n\nREVIEWING THE RESULTS\n\nOnce your contacts are uploaded to Clever, you can search for a contact record using the search bar, or by locating a specific\nstudent's record and navigating to the Guardians tab.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPDATING CONTACT DATA\n\nIn order to update information after the initial upload, re-upload the contact.csv file with the edited or altered data. Manually\nadding or editing contacts is not supported. When re-uploading your contact file, be sure to re-upload the entire file with any\nnew data added to your original file. Uploading a file with only new contacts will delete previously synced contacts. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nCan these contacts be shared with applications?\n\n * Yes! Contacts uploaded via contacts.csv can be shared with applications that support/require student contact information.\n   Contact data is shared implicitly with student records, so there is no need to update your sharing permissions to include\n   student contacts."

If your district does not store Google emails in your student information system (SIS), you can upload an additional CSV\nof emails for your users and the data will be merged within Clever.\n\nStudent_emails.csv and teacher_emails.csv files can only be uploaded via the web browser. SFTP transfer is not supported. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nENABLING EMAIL UPLOADS\n\nIf the district uses Google as a login method for Clever, the district can enable email uploads by following these steps:\n\n 1. Navigate to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings.\n 2. In the configuration for 'Google Authentication', click on 'Edit Settings'.\n 3. On the pop-up screen, select 'Google email addresses are NOT stored in my district's SIS'.\n 4. Select 'Next'.\n 5. On the next screen, check the box next to 'I'll manually upload emails'.\n 6. Select 'Save'.\n 7. Upload your files from your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Upload page in Clever. \n\n         \n\nIf your district does not use Google as a login method for Clever but would like to be able to upload emails through a CSV\nfile, please contact our team and we will enable this feature for your district. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFORMATTING YOUR CSV FILES\n\nIn order to use this tool you will need to create a CSV file that contains two columns: student_id/teacher_id & email. Be sure you\nare using the student_id/teacher_id values as highlighted below, and not the Clever ID.\n\n\nFile Name: student_emails.csv\n\nField\n\nRequired\n\nFormat\n\nDescription\n\nstudent_idYStringStudent’s sis_id, so Clever can tie the email to the associated student. Must be valid Student ID of an existing\nstudent and match the value Student ID on the student profile: \n\nemailYEmailStudent's email address. Must match format x@y.z\n\n\n \n\n\nFile Name: teacher_emails.csv\n\nField\n\nRequired\n\nFormat\n\nDescription\n\nteacher_idYStringTeacher's sis_id, so Clever can tie the email to the associated teacher. Must be valid Teacher ID of an existing\nteacher and match the value Teacher ID on the teacher profile: \n\nemailYEmailTeacher's email address. Must match format x@y.z\n\n \n\nThis file will need to contain a list of the email and the corresponding sis_ids for users. For Google districts, this file will\nbe created using a combination of information from your SIS and your Google admin console. \n\nTeachers and students emails require separate uploads. As such, if you wish to upload both student and teacher emails, you will\nupload two files:\n\n * student_emails.csv\n * teacher_emails.csv\n\nInclude all users' emails that should be overwritten in your upload. Removing a user's email from the CSV file before re-uploading\nthe file will cause the email address record to be deleted.  As an example, if you manually upload user A and user B on day 1, and\nthen on day 2 you need to add user C's email, you would need to upload a file including users A, B, and C, not just C. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW TO UPLOAD YOUR EMAIL FILES\n\nTo upload user emails, navigate to Clever Dashboard > Sync > Upload page in Clever. You can upload the files under\nthe Emails section.\n\nInclude all users' emails that should be overwritten in your upload. Removing an existing user email from the file before\nre-uploading the file will cause the email address record to be deleted as outlined in the section above.  \n\nOnce you have selected the CSV file(s) from your local directory and the cloud status turns green, select 'Upload' to upload user\nemails to Clever.\n\n\n\nPlease note: Please allow 10-15 minutes for custom data to process. Though Clever will not send an email notification that the\ndata has been processed, the results will be viewable on the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard.  \n\n \n\n\nUPDATING EMAILS\n\nIn order to update information after the initial upload you’ll be able re-upload the email files(s) with additional information,\nor you’ll be able to include emails in the SIS data feed for new users who are not listed in the additional file. Always include\nall user's emails that should be active in Clever in your upload. Removing a user email from the file before re-uploading the file\nwill cause the email address record to be deleted.  \n\n\nVIEWING EMAIL UPLOAD ERRORS\n\nTo view errors for your email uploads, navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Upload page and select\n'student_emails_errors.csv' or 'teacher_emails_errors.csv' on the right hand side."

If you’re\nlooking specifically for summer school recommendations, check out this article.\n \n\nIMPORTANT \nFor 2024, Clever automatically pauses syncs on May 31 and removes pauses between July 29 and August 2 unless you specify\notherwise. You can modify these dates (or remove them altogether) under your Sync > Sync Settings page.\n\n \nFor 2024, Clever automatically pauses syncs on May 31 and removes pauses between July 29 and August 2 unless you specify\notherwise. You can modify these dates (or remove them altogether) under your Sync > Sync Settings page.\n\nDuring the pause, Clever will stop processing data updates. This allows districts to make changes to their SIS (Student\nInformation System) data or CSV data files without allowing those changes to flow into Clever and interrupt student, teacher or\nstaff access to Clever or their connected applications over the summer.\n\nCurrent school year data will essentially be \"frozen\" in Clever for the duration of the district's sync pause. \n\nPlease note: If you want to pause syncing your data to a particular application, please see this article: For Clever Admins:\nPausing your sync for a specific app. This is a perfect tool for semester rollover and summer school, but shouldn't be confused\nwith a SIS sync pause. \n\n \n\nIf the district wishes to freeze its data within Clever over the summer, we advise setting your sync pause to a date prior to the\nlast day of school. Please note that a district’s SIS may attempt to delete current data on the last day of school. We recommend\nreaching out to your SIS to determine if this is the case so that you can plan accordingly. \n\n\n\nOnce the sync pause has ended, Clever will automatically resume district's syncing with Clever-managed syncs and will resume\nprocessing SFTP data file uploads. \n\nUnless specified otherwise by your district, Clever automatically removes pauses between July 29 and August 2 to allow Clever\nadmins enough time for review and testing (e.g. ensuring new users are able to log in, app sharing rules are correct, etc.) before\nthe start of school. The 'Pause Start Date' and 'Pause End Date' can be viewed and modified by district admins from the Clever\nDashboard > Sync > Settings page.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDid you know? Application partners manage the app syncing process on their end, so each app sync could be unique. For questions\nabout how apps handle school year rollover, please reach out to the app partner directly.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHEN A DISTRICT'S SYNC IS PAUSED\n\nWhen your district's SIS sync to Clever is paused:\n\n * All Clever admin with Sync pause email notifications turned on will receive an email notification the day before the pause\n   begins. You can see all fellow Clever admin at Clever Dashboard > Team.\n\n * Your sync status will show as \"Paused” in your Clever Dashboard\n\n\n * Please note: Updates to data will not sync from your SIS to Clever during a pause, so changes made in your SIS will not\n   interrupt student, teacher or staff access to Clever or their connected applications.\n   \n   * SFTP uploads will not be processed, even if data is sent to Clever\n   * Clever-managed syncs will run but not process any data changes\n * Applications may still be retrieving data from Clever over the summer even if a district's SIS sync is paused.\n   * If you'd like your application(s) to stop retrieving data from Clever during the sync pause, you can pause app syncs in\n     Clever using the App Sync Pause settings. For more on this, please see Pause your sync for a specific app. \n * Clever admins can still update sharing permissions for applications.\n\n        \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHEN A DISTRICT SYNC PAUSE ENDS OR IS CANCELED\n\nWhen a district's sync pause ends or is canceled: \n\n * All Clever admin with Sync pause email notifications turned on will receive an email notification the day before the pause\n   ends. You can see all fellow Clever admin at Clever Dashboard > Team.\n * Clever will once again resume:\n   * Syncing with your SIS (auto-syncs)\n   * Or processing your next SFTP upload (SFTP syncs)\n\n * If the rostering data in Clever changes significantly once the sync resumes, your sync will be placed on an automatic hold as a\n   safeguard to provide you time to review the rostering changes before they are processed. Of note, if Clever detects an unusual\n   amount of potentially disruptive data changes, the Clever Support team will be notified when you attempt to approve these\n   changes to assist you with review. Learn more about sync holds.\n   \n   * District admins can review sync changes before they are processed from the Clever Dashboard > Sync page by using the Download\n     Changes option to the right of each data type.\n   \n    \n\n             \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPAUSE DATES\n\nDistrict admins can make adjustments to the sync 'Pause Start Date' and 'Pause End Date' from the District Dashboard > Sync >\nSettings page as follows:\n\n * Pause Start Date: This will be the first day your sync goes on pause, which should coincide with the last day of the current\n   school year.\n   * Please note: Your current school year data should still be active in your SIS on this day.\n * Pause End Date: This will be the last day your sync is paused, which should be the day before your SIS data is active for the\n   upcoming school year. \n   * For example: If next school year's data will be active in your SIS on 8/15/24, your Pause End Date should be set for 8/14/24.\n     This might also be your last day of summer.\n   * Sync pauses run from 12:00 AM on the pause start date to 11:59 PM on the pause end date, local time. For example, if you wish\n     to resume syncing with Clever on August 10th, please set the Pause End Date to August 9th.\n\nPlease note: If possible, we recommend unpausing your district's sync a week or two in advance of the new school year to give you\ntime to review the changes, see if there are any errors, and let your district know.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nROLLOVER DATE\n\nIn Clever, the rollover date marks the transition of district data from the previous school year to the upcoming one. This usually\noccurs during the summer when the data for the upcoming school year is live but before the first day of school. District admins\nwill be prompted to choose the rollover date upon removing the 'Pause Start Date' and 'Pause End Date' in the Clever Dashboard >\nSync > Settings. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIt's important to mark the new school year rollover date in Clever as it enables us to guarantee the seamless functioning of your\napplications. This proactive approach ensures that your Clever account is fully primed and operational for the upcoming school\nyear!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSUMMER SCHOOL\n\nIf you’re looking specifically for summer school recommendations, check out Summer school: Overview.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING DATA FOR THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR\n\nIf you are not seeing the current school year data in Clever: \n\n1. Confirm that your account is not on pause.\nData for the new school year will not be able to sync to Clever until the pause is removed from your sync. You can adjust your\npause dates from the bottom of the Sync > Settings page.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Confirm that data was synced to Clever after the pause was removed. \nYou will not see data for the next academic year in Clever until we receive a set of data after the pause is removed. If your new\ndata was uploaded to Clever prior to the pause being removed, please re-upload the data to Clever.\n\n3. Confirm your data is not on hold\nSince there are often major changes to data when transitioning school years, your data sync will likely go on hold. You can\napprove the data changes to release your hold from the Clever Dashboard > Sync page. \n\n4. Confirm your student information system (SIS) is sending new school year's data to Clever\nRollover information for Clever-managed syncs can be found in our Help Center. For all other sync types and SISs, please contact\nthe support team for your SIS. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPREPARING FOR THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL\n\nHere are some key recommendations to help you prepare for the new school year in Clever:\n\n1. Student Information System (SIS)\n\n * Confirm that the new rosters are active in your SIS so they'll successfully sync to Clever.\n * If you'll be sharing data with Clever before you want students or teachers to see the new school year data, you can temporarily\n   turn off access to Clever with Access Controls. \n\n2. Sync Hold\n\n * Confirm that your SIS sync is no longer on hold from your District Dashboard > Sync page.\n\n3. Applications\n\n * Review all application sharing permissions to ensure the appropriate data is shared prior to the start of school.\n   \n   * Please note: If your district is “sharing by section” with any applications, you may need to update your section sharing\n     rules for app partners to retrieve the new data.\n * Confirm all district apps are launched, and the syncs are active. Navigate to your District Dashboard and click on the\n   application name to open the app overview page to verify these details. \n   \n   * If the sync does not appear to be running, please check that any App Sync Pauses have been removed or reach out to the\n     application support team directly for assistance\n\n                \n\n * For rostering/SSO applications, be sure you have spot-checked students and teachers to ensure they are being logged in\n   successfully to the app(s) through Clever. This can be done using the Impersonating a User: 'Access Portal as' Feature.\n * If your district uses any SSO (Saved Passwords) applications, ensure you’ve provisioned accounts directly with the app, then\n   configured the user credentials in Clever and tested them to make sure they’re working.\n * For priority connections, we recommend communicating with the vendor when your data is ready to be synced for the new school\n   year.\n\n4. Data Browser\n\n * From your District Dashboard > Data Browser, spot-check the following:\n   * Students:\n     * Ensure pertinent details are in Clever for your students (e.g. email address, student numbers, section enrollments, apps,\n       etc.)\n   * Teachers:\n     * Ensure pertinent details are in Clever for your teachers (e.g. email address, section assignments, apps, etc.)\n   * Sections: \n     * Ensure the updated sections for the new school year are in Clever and look correct. \n     * If co-teachers need to be manually assigned to sections in Clever, follow the instructions in this article. \n   * Staff:\n     * Ensure any non-instructional staff who need access to Clever are showing under the 'Staff' tab and their pertinent details\n       are present (e.g. email address, staff ID). See this article for more information about staff.\n\n5. Badges\n\n * If your district uses Clever Badges for student logins, it will be important to ensure the Badges are either:\n   * Still active (Unless your district opts to keep Badges active, they will be voided after the scheduled SIS sync pause has\n     ended). Learn more about Summer Badge invalidation and opting out here.  \n   * Or, new Badges are printed and distributed for students if your district voided Badges for the new school year.\n\n \n\n  Reusing Section IDs: Clever refreshes all Clever IDs associated with section_ids to ensure new sections do not retain data from\nthe previous school year within connected applications. \n\nThis shouldn't impact students and teachers retaining historical data in their apps because app partners expect all new sections\nfor the start of the school year. When your district's sync unpauses, Clever automatically provisions all sections with new Clever\nIDs even if the section IDs stay the same.\n\nThat said, some applications require that Section_ids (not just the Clever IDs associated with the section IDs) be unique to the\nacademic year. As such, Clever discourages reusing section_ids between academic years.\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nCHANGING YOUR SIS, SYNC METHOD, OR SIS IDS\n\n\nChanging your Student Information System (SIS)\nIf you are changing your Student Information System (SIS), please contact Clever Support to notify us of the upcoming change. Our\nteam will partner with you to create a migration plan and timeline based on your new SIS and available sync methods. Please allow\nat least 2-3 weeks to complete the migration with Clever Support. We highly recommend starting this process at least a month\nbefore your first day of school. For more information on the transition process, please see this article: Changing Student\nInformation Systems.\n\n\nChanging your sync method\nIf your district is using the same Student Information System (SIS) for the upcoming year, but would like to change sync methods,\nplease contact Clever Support for consultation. We will work with you to confirm the sync method provides access to the data\nrequired for your connected applications. Depending on the sync method, please allow up to 2 weeks for the migration to be\ncompleted. If moving to an SFTP method, we recommend a minimum of 3 weeks to ensure the CSV files sent to Clever are complete and\nformatted correctly. We HIGHLY recommend starting this process at least a month before your first day of school.\n\nWhen changing sync methods, we recommend maintaining the same primary identifiers (SIS IDs) for your students, teachers, schools,\netc. This will ensure historical data is retained in Clever and connected applications. If SIS IDs are changing, our team will\nneed to complete a matching process to preserve existing accounts. In addition to the time to set up the new sync method, please\nallow an additional 1 week for the account matching process. \n\nFor more information on changing sync methods, please see this article.\n\n\nChanging SIS IDs\nCommonly, the need to change the SIS ID for users is due to a district needing to meet the data requirements for a specific\nconnection. Clever Support may be able to help you meet this data requirement without disrupting your existing data in Clever. If\nyou need to change SIS IDs to meet an application requirement, contact our team with the following:  \n\n * The name of the application that requires the data change\n * The user record type that requires the SIS ID change (students, teachers, etc.)\n * The name of the field from your SIS that you need in the SIS ID field in Clever\n\n\nOur team will review the requirements and communicate the next steps to ensure a successful connection to the application while\nminimizing disruption to your existing applications. \n\nFor more information on changing SIS IDs, please see this article."

As the data in your\nSIS changes, you can expect to see the following behavior with your sync:\n\n * When your CSV files no longer include first term classes or enrollments, Clever will place your sync on hold because the number\n   of student-class enrollments will change significantly.\n * To review the hold, navigate to your Clever Last Attempted Sync page.\n * If the data looks correct, click \"Approve\". Once the hold is cleared, your new term rosters will begin populating in Clever as\n   they become active in your SIS. If the the data looks incorrect, please contact Clever Support for assistance.\n\nFor more information on clearing holds, please see: How do I release a hold?\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAUTO SYNC ROLLOVER PROCEDURE\n\nClever pulls the students, teachers, and rosters that are active in your SIS. As the data in your SIS changes, you can expect to\nsee the following behavior with your sync:\n\n * When first-term classes are no longer active in your SIS, or as enrollments change, your Clever sync may go on hold: \"pending\n   significant changes in the data.\"\n * To review the hold, navigate to your Clever Last Attempted Sync page.\n * If the data looks correct, click \"Approve\". Once the hold is cleared, your new term rosters will begin populating in Clever as\n   they become active in your SIS. If the data looks incorrect, please contact Clever Support for assistance.\n\nFor more information on clearing holds, please see: How do I release a hold?\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED DISTRICT ACTIONS:\n\n\n1. REVIEW YOUR DISTRICT'S SYNC INFORMATION\n\n * For SFTP syncs: Check your inbox for emails from Clever. \n   * If you receive any error message in your email such as, \"Error Processing Clever SFTP Upload\" please review the sync status\n     on your Last Attempted Sync page.\n   * See this article to resolve any sync status errors you may have: \"How do I resolve SFTP sync status errors?\"\n   * If your sync is still \"On Hold\", navigate to your Last Attempted Sync page to approve the changes. \n\n * For Auto Syncs: Review your Clever Last Attempted Sync page as soon as your term data rolls over in your SIS.\n   * If your sync is still \"On Hold\", navigate to your Last Attempted Sync page to approve the changes. \n\n\n\n\n2. REVIEW YOUR SHARING PERMISSIONS\n\nIf you are currently utilizing sharing by rules for any applications, we recommend reviewing any sections where rules that filter\non Term Name. If a rule contains a filter for Term Name, you may need to adjust your sharing permissions to ensure the desired\nsections for the new term are available to the application.\n\nIn the example below, the account will want to update the Term Name filter when transitioning from the Fall → Spring term. \n\n\n\nYou can review and edit your sharing permissions by selecting the link near your listed application under the \"Sharing\" section.\nIn the screenshot below, the links to review are those with \"Sharing by rules\":\n\n\n\nPlease note: If you want to pause syncing your data to a particular application, please see this article: For Clever Admins:\nPausing your sync for a specific app.  This is a perfect tool for semester rollover and summer school, but shouldn't be confused\nwith an SIS sync pause.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. REVIEW SECTION_IDS\n\nFor term rollover, it is important to make sure that the ID #s for sections (the section_id field in Clever) are different after a\nterm or school year rollover. This is because Clever's system 'remembers' sections that have been deleted, based on their\nsection_id.\n\nIf you have any questions about where to find your section_id based on your sync type, please do not hesitate to contact Clever\nSupport!\n\n \n\n\n 4. CHANGING SIS IDS (STUDENT_ID, TEACHER_ID, ETC.)\n\nDuring term rollovers, there are many districts that approach Clever about changing the primary identifiers (commonly called SIS\nIDs) for one or more record types. The following values are SIS IDs in Clever: \n\n * Student_id\n * Teacher_id\n * Staff_id\n * School_id\n * Section_id\n\n\nClever highly advises against changing these values in the middle of a school year. Doing so presents a significant risk of loss\nof historical data for users mid-year. If your district has a critical need to adjust SIS IDs mid-year, please reach out to Clever\nsupport for consultation. Commonly the need to change the SIS ID for users is due to a district needing to meet the data\nrequirements for a specific connection. Clever Support may be able to help you meet this data requirement without disrupting your\nexisting data in Clever. \n\nIf you require changing SIS IDs mid-year and cannot wait until the summer academic rollover, please see this article: Changing SIS\nIDs. Please note, it may take up to 2 weeks to complete the migration process. If you intend on changing SIS IDs, please plan\naccordingly to ensure minimal disruption to students and teachers."

Manually adding existing teachers as co-teachers\n6. Creating new custom teachers\n7. Removing co-teachers\n8. Co-teachers in applications\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCo-teachers are supplementary teachers assigned to sections in your SIS but are not considered the primary teacher. Clever's\nability to sync co-teachers depends on your sync type, read on to find out more information!\n \n\n Please note: Some connected applications may not support co-teachers. Please reach out to the application partner's directly to\nconfirm if they do support co-teachers.\n\n \n\n * If co-teachers are missing from your connected application, first check your data in Clever. If co-teachers are missing in\n   Clever, please read the information below on how to add them to Clever.\n * If co-teachers are syncing to your Clever account but missing from your connected application, please reach out to that\n   application team to learn how their system handles multiple teachers.\n * Clever supports a total of 10 teachers per section, including one primary teacher and up to 9 co-teachers.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDING CO-TEACHERS IN SFTP SYNCS\n\nThe \"Teacher_id\" column in the sections.csv file indicates the primary teacher for that section. Multiple teachers are added to\nsections through the columns \"Teacher_2_id\", \"Teacher_3_id\", and \"Teacher_4_id\", etc. Clever supports up to 9 co-teachers per\nsection.\n\nA sections.csv file formatted for co-teachers looks like this:\n\n\nPlease note: Each teacher_id must correspond to a record in the teachers.csv file. Check out Clever's SFTP spec for more\ninformation on CSV formatting; page 13 outlines the multiple teacher_id fields. Once the multiple teacher_id fields are added to\nthe sections.csv file, as well as the teachers.csv file, upload the updated files to Clever. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nADDING CO-TEACHERS IN SIS-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS\n\nPlease contact your SIS if you would like co-teachers added to your sync. Similar to the process for SFTP syncs, your SIS will\nneed to add multiple teachers through the \"Teacher_2_id\", \"Teacher_3_id\", and \"Teacher_4_id\" fields in the sections.csv sent to\nClever. Click here to learn more about SIS-Managed Auto Syncs.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nSYNCING CO-TEACHERS IN CLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS\n\nTo learn if your Auto Sync supports co-teachers, please go to the Clever-Managed Auto Sync page here  and select your SIS page.\nThe Auto Sync's \"Functionality\" section at the top of that page will indicate if the Auto Sync can support co-teachers. Auto Syncs\nthat support co-teachers will bring them into Clever automatically. For example:\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nMANUALLY ADDING EXISTING TEACHERS IN CLEVER AS CO-TEACHERS\n\n\n\nIf your sync doesn't support the export of co-teachers, your district can manually add co-teachers to sections directly from a\nsection's detail page. Sections can be easily accessed using the search bar at the top of your Clever dashboard.\n\nPlease allow up to 24 hours for manually added co-teachers to be synced by connected applications. If you do not see co-teachers\nappear in the application, you can contact the application's support team to confirm they support co-teachers on their platform. \n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nCREATING NEW CUSTOM TEACHERS IN CLEVER\n\nIf you'd like to add a teacher who doesn't sync from the SIS, you can do this by clicking create a teacher in the modal.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll enter basic demographic information about the user in the subsequent screen in order to create this user.\n\n\nPlease allow up to 24 hours for your custom-created teachers to sync by connected applications. If you do not see custom-created\nteachers appear in the application, you can contact the application's support team to confirm they support co-teachers on their\nplatform.\n\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nREMOVING CO-TEACHERS\n\nThe process of removing a co-teacher from a section will depend on how the co-teacher was added to the section. If a co-teacher\nwas added manually, admins will be able to remove the association directly from the section profile in Clever. \n\n\n\nIf this option is not available, the co-teacher association was synced directly from your student information system (SIS). To\nremove the co-teacher, the association will need to be removed in the SIS. Once removed, the co-teacher association will be\nremoved on the next sync with Clever.  \n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nCO-TEACHERS IN APPLICATIONS\n\nWhile all rostering applications on Clever have access to shared co-teacher data, it depends on the application partner whether\nthey support co-teachers or not. The application partners also take care of managing permissions and access control for\nco-teachers within their app.\n\nIf you have any questions about co-teacher behavior in an application, please don't hesitate to reach out to the application's\nsupport team directly. They'll be more than happy to assist you!"

How often can you sync your data?\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) sync allows school districts to “push” data to Clever. Districts generate five required\nCSV files (schools.csv, teachers.csv, students.csv, sections.csv, and enrollments.csv) from their student information system\n(SIS), or manually create the files according to Clever's specified file format. These files include fields required by learning\napplications for each of the required five data types. You may include the optional staff.csv file for your non-instructional\nstaff, but it isn't required. The district then securely transfers these files to Clever.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREVIEW SFTP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n * Review Clever’s SFTP Instructions to learn how to format your CSV files, and to identify which fields are required by Clever\n   and your learning applications. Please note that fields in bold are required by Clever, and fields highlighted in yellow must\n   remain consistent across all CSV files.  The templates for these CSV files can be found here. \n * If you’ve already signed up for a Clever account, select your sync type on the Sync > Settings page in your Clever Dashboard.\n   If you will be using an SFTP sync, you'll find the Clever SFTP Specifications specific to your district which include fields\n   required by your connected applications.\n * Not yet signed up? Take a look at our general SFTP instructions here. If you have questions about the instructions, please\n   request help before proceeding by clicking the chat icon in the bottom right corner of this page.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEXPORT DATA\n\n * Export your data from your student information system (SIS). Be sure to export all required fields.\n * Data can be exported directly from your SIS or through an SQL query.\n * If you’re unable to produce the required fields, please contact your SIS directly. Clever is unable to troubleshoot data\n   exporting from SIS and SQL for SFTP Syncs.\n * We also recommend automating the process of exporting data from your SIS and uploading it to Clever.\n\n Please note: If you do not utilize a SIS, you can manually create the required CSV files for syncing data to Clever in a program\nsuch as Excel or Google Sheets.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFORMAT FILES\n\n * Format the five required CSV files (schools.csv, teachers.csv, students.csv, sections.csv, and enrollments.csv) according to\n   Clever’s specified file format. If you're including the optional staff.csv file, make sure to format that as well.\n * If you run into any issues, see Troubleshooting CSV formatting errors for help!\n\n Clever Tip: Making your files yourself? Check out our tutorial videos for each file type: Schools.csv, students.csv,\nteachers.csv, sections.csv, enrollments.csv.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOAD DATA\n\n * Securely transfer the data to Clever using one of these two options:\n   * District admins can upload files manually via the Clever Dashboard > Sync > Upload page. Need help using the Web Upload tool?\n     See this article. \n   * Or, district admins can upload district data directly to the district's Clever SFTP folder using an FTP client (e.g.,\n     Transmit, FileZilla, or WinSCP). Click here for instructions on uploading data using an FTP client, or check out our\n     clickable tutorial. You’ll need your SFTP credentials from your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings page. This SFTP option\n     also allows districts to write a script that automates the upload process.\n\n\nOnboarding to Clever and want to learn about uploading CSV files? Check out our Onboarding - Getting your schools’ data into\nClever course, available in Clever Academy!\n\n   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPDATE YOUR DATA\n\n * Repeat the steps above to update the data in Clever when student, teacher, or roster information changes.\n * Be sure to include all five files in your upload, and include ALL records for each file type. Your files should always contain\n   all data. Clever will handle necessary additions, deletions, and updates.\n * You can always check your sync status on your Clever Dashboard homepage - here are some common error messages.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nHOW OFTEN CAN YOU SYNC YOUR DATA?\n\n * You can sync as often as you want! However, if your sync has been automated it may be set to sync once a day.\n * When a new set of files is sent to your SFTP directory we will automatically trigger a sync. Uploading too many times in a\n   short period of time may trigger a sync upload error.\n\nPlease note: Files cascade and depend on one another. If there are no schools, then we cannot process students or teachers. If\nthere are no students, we cannot process enrollments. If there are no enrollments, then we cannot process sections.  The graphic\nbelow shows how the files work together:"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Clever-Managed Auto Syncs\n3. SIS-Managed Auto Syncs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever offers two types of \"Managed Auto Syncs\" that districts can utilize to securely sync (i.e., transfer) rostering data from\nthe district's student information system (SIS) to Clever. Clever Admins can then selectively share specific data with their\ndistrict's connected learning applications. This article will detail the types of Managed Auto Syncs that Clever offers.\n\nPlease note: If your district's student information system (SIS) is not listed below, or you would prefer to manually upload data,\nplease visit this article for information on how to get started: Which sync type should I choose?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS\n\n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nClever-Managed Auto Syncs are automated daily syncs primarily managed by the Clever Support team. These syncs securely transfer\nrostering data from your district's student information system (SIS) to Clever. With these types of syncs:\n\n * Clever integrates with your SIS to regularly export data and securely transfer it to Clever. \n * Once SIS data is synced to Clever, Clever Admins can selectively share that data with the district's connected learning\n   applications.\n * The Clever Support team manages these types of syncs, so minimal help, if any, is needed from a district's SIS provider.\n * Clever does not charge for SIS-Managed Auto Syncs!\n\n \n\n\nLIST OF CLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNC SISES:\n\n * Aeries\n * Blackbaud\n * PowerSchool\n * Skyward\n\n \n\n\nCAN I CUSTOMIZE WHAT ROSTERING DATA IS SYNCED TO CLEVER FROM OUR SIS?\n\nIn many cases, when setting up your Clever-Managed Auto Sync, the Clever Support team can assist with adding various filters or\nmappings to ensure the data in Clever reflects your district's needs. We can often remove unwanted fields or include additional\nfields in the sync. However, there are some limitations regarding how much data we can filter or how many fields we can map.\n\nThere are also ways for Clever Admins to determine which fields (e.g., student number, teacher email, staff ID) Clever should map\nto from the district's SIS so that the data populates correctly in Clever. This can be done from the Clever Dashboard > Sync >\nSettings > Field Mappings page. \n\nPlease note that there are cases where Clever Support will need to map specific fields on behalf of districts. These fields will\nnot show the option to Edit under the Actions column. Please contact Clever Support for more information or if a field is\nunavailable for mapping.\n\n\n\nPlease note: OneRoster API syncs do not allow for customizations by Clever. Any customizations to these types of syncs would need\nto be configured by the district's SIS provider.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?\n\nIf your district is interested in setting up a Clever-Managed Auto Sync, the first step would be to identify if your district's\nstudent information system (SIS) allows for this. Please see the Student Information Systems (SIS) that support Managed Auto\nSyncs section of this article for more information. If your SIS is not listed, an alternative option would be to set up a secure\nfile transfer protocol (SFTP) sync type to securely transmit data to Clever or to manually upload data to Clever via the\nSync > Upload page. \n\nPlease visit this article for more information: Which sync type should I choose?\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSIS-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS\n\n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nFor SIS-Managed Auto Syncs, Clever partners directly with the district's student information system (SIS) provider to offer an\nautomated sync option that the district's SIS provider would primarily manage. \n\n * Clever does not require credentials or access to your district's SIS directly. \n * To take advantage of these SIS-managed syncs, please select your SIS from the Clever sign-up page when requesting a new Clever\n   account.\n * Clever will then provide instructions directing your district on how to configure your district's SIS sync to Clever.\n * Clever doesn't charge schools or districts to use this sync type or any other aspects of our core platform. We don't have\n   insight into costs (if any) charged by a SIS to configure an automated SFTP export to a vendor.\n\n\n\nLIST OF SIS-MANAGED AUTO SYNC SISES:\n\n * Arbor\n * Ascender\n * Illuminate\n * SchoolInsight\n * ADAM\n * Aspen\n * Beehively\n * Chalkable iNOW (formerly STI)\n * Classe365\n * Educate\n * Edupoint Synergy\n * eSchoolData\n * FACTS SIS\n * Focus SIS\n * Genius SIS\n * go.edustar\n * Harmony\n * iPASS\n * JMC\n * JCampus\n * Jupiter iO\n * Lumen AXSIS\n * MiDataHub\n * MiStar\n * MMS\n * OASIS\n * OnCourse Systems for Education\n * ProgressBook (formally DASL for Ohio)\n * Q\n * QuickSchools\n * RDS\n * Realtime Inc.\n * Rediker\n * FACTS SIS - RenWeb\n * SalamanderSoft\n * SAM Spectra\n * SchoolBrains\n * SchoolSpeak\n * School Pathways\n * School Time\n * Sycamore\n * TEAMS\n * TxEIS\n * Tyler Schoolmaster\n * Tyler v9\n * Tyler v10\n\n\n\nCAN I CUSTOMIZE WHAT ROSTER DATA IS SYNCED?\n\nWith SIS-managed syncs, Clever has little insight into how data is filtered and exported from your district's student information\nsystem (SIS), so while we can provide guidance, we cannot implement changes or, in most cases, troubleshoot beyond reviewing the\nfiles we receive. To resolve any issues, please contact your SIS representative (or whoever configured the Clever SFTP export)\ndirectly for support.\n \n\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?\n\nAfter creating your Clever account, please visit your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings page for instructions on how to activate\nyour SIS-Managed Auto Sync.\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\n * What is Clever?\n * Sign up for Clever here!\n * Which sync type should I choose?\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): What is SSO?"

Staff can be manually added to Clever using these directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\nPowerSchool + Gsuite Integration\nThe Clever-managed Auto Sync is not compatible with PowerSchool instances that use the Gsuite integration or any other secondary\nsingle sign-on (SSO) integrations. If your district utilizes Gsuite with PowerSchool or another SSO integration, please see our\ndirections for setting up the PowerSchool Plugin Sync or an SFTP sync. \n\nNew to Clever? Please contact your district onboarding specialist for setup directions. If you have not yet connected with a\ndistrict onboarding specialist, you can sign up here.\n\nIf you have an existing Clever account and would like to transition to the Clever-managed auto sync for PowerSchool, please\ncontact our support team using support.clever.com for details on changing your sync type. Please note, the process of changing\nsync types can take 2-3 weeks. We highly recommend reviewing the conversion process as outlined here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATIONS\n\n * Your sync can be customized to sync nightly, instead of every four hours, but the time of day that the syncs occur is not\n   customizable. Syncs can always be initiated/forced at any time from your Clever Dashboard on the Sync page > Settings tab >\n   Sync Controls box > Sync Now button\n * Clever can filter exports from PowerSchool to limit the schools, teachers, or students included in the sync. Reach out to\n   Clever Support if you would like to filter exports.\n * To request customizations or filtering for your PowerSchool sync, please submit a request to Clever Support.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNCING STUDENT EMAILS\n\nFor information on syncing student emails, please see this article.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNCING POWERSCHOOL STUDENT CONTACTS\n\nClever pulls student contact data from the Students table in the DDE in PowerSchool by default. For reference, here are the\ndefault contact fields:\n\n * Emerg Contact 1\n * Emerg Contact 2\n * Emerg Contact 3\n * Emerg Phone 1\n * Emerg Phone 2\n * Emerg Phone 3\n * Emerg 1 Ptype\n * Emerg 2 Ptype\n * Emerg 3 Ptype\n * Emerg 1 Rel\n * Emerg 2 Rel\n * Emerg 3 Rel\n\nHowever, if you're using PowerSchool version 12+, the student contact table resides in the Data Export Manager (DEM) and\nallows for unlimited student contacts.  In order for Clever to sync these contacts from the DEM, you will need to first grant\nClever access to the DEM. You can find more information here: PowerSchool v12+: Student Contacts.\n\nAlternatively, you can upload student contacts directly to Clever. With this option, your district can maintain maximum control\nand flexibility over which contacts you'd like to populate in Clever. You can upload contacts directly on your district dashboard.\nThey will populate in Clever within about 15 minutes and should be available within your connected applications the following day.\nYou can view instructions on how to upload contacts here: Manually Uploading Student Contacts to Clever.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSCHOOL YEAR ROLLOVER\n\nOn July 2nd, Clever will begin syncing data for the next school year. If you would like to begin syncing enrollments for the new\nSchool Year before August, please request assistance from Clever Support.\n\nIf you notice the previous academic year's data syncing alongside the current academic year data, please contact Clever Support\nrequesting that the filters for TermID and DateLeft be updated for your configuration. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\n\n\nMISSING RECORDS \n\nIf an entire record is missing, we recommend checking the following in PowerSchool:\n\nRecord Type\n\nTroubleshooting Steps\n\nStudentsClever will only sync students that meet the following conditions: \n * Record is active\n * enroll_status = 0\n\nTeachersClever will only sync teachers that meet the following conditions: \n * Record is active (\"Active\" box is checked)\n * Assigned to a school, not the district office (school_id = 0)\n * status = 1\n\nSectionsClever will only sync sections that meet the following conditions:\n * Minimum of 1 active student enrolled\n * No_of_students > 0\n * TermID >= 3200 (please refer to TermID for current academic year)\n\nStaffClever does not automatically sync records from PowerSchool to the Staff role in Clever.\n\nThere may be users such as administrators, custodians, and para-professionals who might not use PowerSchool directly but need\naccess to applications through Clever. If those users are missing from your Clever data, there are two options to sync them to\nClever.\n\nOption A) Sync as teacher\nTo sync the user as a teacher, confirm they meet the record requirements as outlined above. \n\nOption B) Manually add to Clever using Custom Data\nIf the user requires access to teacher features or will need to be connected to a section, add the user as a Custom Teacher.  \n\nIf the user does not require teacher features and only will be using Clever for Single Sign-On (SSO), add the user as Custom\nStaff. \n\n \n\n\nINCORRECT DATA FOR A RECORD\n\nFirst, check if the data is correct in PowerSchool. You can view the default field mappings for PowerSchool syncs here.\n\nIf you have customized your sync, you can view your custom mappings by navigating to the Sync > Settings page in your Clever\nDashboard. In the Sync Mappings box, click on View field mappings. In this example: \n\n 1. If a teacher's email address was incorrect, confirm the email is correct in the \"Email_addr\" field in PowerSchool.\n 2. If a teacher is missing State_teacher_id, you will see that Clever is not currently pulling this data. Please contact Clever\n    Support to see what options may be available to pull this data. \n\n\n\n\nUPDATING CREDENTIALS\n\nIf you need to update your PowerSchool credentials for any reason, you can do so on your Sync page and simply input the updated\ncredentials and click Update.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNC ERRORS\n\nBelow you can find solutions to common sync errors that may display in your Clever Dashboard. \n\nError Message\n\nSolution\n\n“PowerSchool is not currently available at the URL provided. Please update the URL in your system settings page if necessary.”\n\nSome common causes for URL errors include:\n\n * URL includes a typo\n * URL does not direct to a valid SIS login page\n * URL is not accessible from outside of your district’s network/VPN\n * URL access is blocked by firewall restrictions\n * The district needs to allowlist Clever's IP addresses \n\nYou can update the PowerSchool URL on the Sync > Settings page.\n\n“Invalid username/password specified. Please check SIS credentials on the settings page.”\n\nYour district's PowerSchool login URL has changed or the credentials have expired, changed, or are no longer valid.\n\nYou can update your district's credentials on the Sync > Settings page. \n\nHere is an article to assist with correcting this error and get your district's sync back up and running: Sync Error: How do I\nresolve \"Invalid username/password specified\"?“Account locked due to sign in attempts with incorrect password. Please contact your\nSIS administrator to remove this restriction.\"\n\nIn order to get your district's sync back up and running successfully, you can follow the steps in this article.\n\n\"The password on the SIS account needs to be reset. Please log in to PowerSchool to set a new password, then update SIS\ncredentials on settings page.\"\n\nStep 1: Log in to PowerSchool as an administrator and reset the password for the Clever access account. You can see the username\nyou’ve shared with Clever on your Sync > Settings page. \n\nStep 2: In a new window, log in to PowerSchool with the Clever access account username and the new password.\n\nStep 3: Enter the temporary password and create a new password.\n\nStep 4: Update the Sync > Settings page in your Dashboard with the new password.\n\n\"No active enrollments found for the school term configured in Clever.\"\n\nClever will only syncs enrollments (CC) if the DateLeft is greater than 8/1 of the current year.\n\nVerify that enrollments for your district meet this requirement. Once the enrollments meet this requirement, your district's sync\nwill resume.\n\n“Failed to export Sections: got error Alert: Cannot Export No sections selected Export: Back”\n\nConfirm there is active section data in PowerSchool and that the schedules for the new school year have been published.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDEFAULT FIELD MAPPINGS\n\nBelow are the default field mappings for PowerSchool Auto Syncs that are managed by Clever. Please note:\n\n * If a field is blank, the field is either not pulled by default, or not accessible to Clever.\n * If you want to change a field mapping, please contact Clever Support to learn what options are available. \n * If a field is not coming through with the correct value, Clever Support may need to complete a value mapping. This is common\n   for grade, FRL_Status, ELL_Status, and IEP_Status.\n * Your district may have custom field mappings applied.

Once this is done, the Clever sync will also need access to the correct calendars (see step G in this attached\ndocument ).\n\n\n\nBy default, Clever uses the cal_startDate and cal_endDate fields to determine the start and end of the school year. If you're not\nready to start syncing rosters for the next school year, you can pause your Clever sync.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf an entire record is missing, we recommend checking the following:\n\nRecord Type\n\nTroubleshooting Steps\n\nStudent\n * ActiveToday = 1\n * The student's record must have an end date in the future, or none at all\n * The student must be assigned to a school that is present in the auto sync data\n * Check whether the user's inner join fields, such as usage.username, are all populated\n\nTeacher\n * The teacher must have a district employment record\n * The teacher's record must have an end date in the future, or none at all\n * Check whether the user's inner join fields, such as usage.username, are all populated\n   if a staff member is assigned to the District Office but no school, their record will not sync to Clever\n\nStaff\n * Clever does not sync records from Infinite Campus to the Staff role in Clever.\n\nSchool\n * The school must have at least one active student enrolled\n * Ensure that you've provisioned the correct calendar rights for Clever, see \"Permissions\" as outlined in our setup documentation\n\nSection\n * If syncing term data, confirm the record has cal.startDate and cal.endDate populated. Failure to populate these fields will\n   result in the section not exporting from Infinite Campus.\n\n \n\nIf the record (student, teacher, section) is in Clever but data is missing or incorrect for the record (i.e. incorrect email,\nmissing username), navigate to the Sync > Settings page in your Clever Dashboard. Under Sync Controls, click on View field\nmappings\n\n\nHere you can view which fields Clever is pulling for each record and field. In the below example: \n \n\n 1. If a teacher's email address was incorrect, confirm the email is correct in the \"pcontact_email\" field in Infinite Campus\n 2. If a teacher is missing State_teacher_id, you will see that Clever is not currently pulling this data. Please contact Clever\n    Support to see what options may be available to pull this data. \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\nClever requires specific permission levels in order to facilitate an automatic sync with Infinite Campus. In addition to these\npermissions, we also recommend the following: Create an individual SIS account only for Clever - no one else should log in with\nthe same credentials. Limit Clever's SIS account to read-only access.\n\nClever allows the student data in Infinite Campus to automatically sync with authorized applications. This eliminates the need for\nmanual CSV transfers or complicated SFTP uploads. To allow the data sync to happen, Clever needs to be able to access a school’s\nInfinite Campus instance. The best practice when using Clever is to create a new Infinite Campus user for Clever to use that is\nread-only except for Ad Hoc Reporting.\n\n \n\nPlease follow these steps to Enable Permissions:\n\n \n\n 1. To configure the permissions for the Clever user, navigate to the following path: System Administration > User Security >\n    Users > Tool Rights\n 2. Ensure Clever has Read access to Student Information according to the following screen shot:\n    1. \n    2. \n    3. \n    4. \n 3. Ensure Clever has Read access to Census—Student and Staff ID Numbers and Staff Employment Status—access according to the\n    following screen shot:\n    1. \n    2. \n 4. Ensure Clever has Read access to Scheduling according to the following screen shot:\n    1. \n 5. Full rights will need to be given for creating and deleting reports. Reporting is limited to those areas selected above.\n    1. \n 6. Log off ability – full rights needed here.\n    1. \n 7. You’ll also need to adjust calendar rights by navigating to the following path: System Administration > User Security > Users\n    > Calendar Rights. Update calendar rights per the screen shot below, and make sure the check box for “Modify Rights” is\n    selected. Specific schools can be selected if district access is not desired. NOTE: selecting this box does not give Clever\n    the ability to modify your calendar; access is still Read Only\n    1. \n    2. \n\n \n\nHere's what your Tool Rights Summary should look like once you are done:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDEFAULT FIELD MAPPINGS\n\nBelow are the default field mappings for Infinite Campus Auto Syncs that are managed by Clever. If your district uses the Infinite\nCampus OneRoster API to sync data to Clever, please see this article.\n\n * Your district may have custom field mappings applied. To view the specific mappings for your account, navigate to the Sync >\n   Settings page in your Clever dashboard. Under Sync Controls, click on View field mappings\n * If a field is blank, the field is either not pulled by default, or not accessible to Clever\n * If you want to change a field mapping, please contact Clever Support to learn what options are available. \n * If a field is not coming through with the correct value, Clever Support may need to complete a value mapping. This is common\n   for Grade, FRL_Status, ELL_Status, and IEP_Status.\n\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDsch_schoolGUIDSchool_Namesch_nameSchool_Numbersch_schoolIDState_ID Low_Grade High_Grade Principalsch_principalNamePrincipal_Emailsch_principalEmailSchool_Addresssch_addressSchool_Citysch_citySchool_Statesch_stateSchool_Zipsch_zipSchool_Phonesch_phone\n\n\n \n\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDsch_schoolGUIDStudent_IDstudent_personIDStudent_Numberstudent_studentNumberState_IDstudent_stateIDFirst_Namestudent_firstNameMiddle_Name Last_Namestudent_lastNameGradestudent_gradeGenderstudent_genderGraduation_Yeargraduation_projectedGraduationDateDOBstudent_birthdateRacestudent_raceEthnicity,\nfedRace_hispanicLatino,\nfedRace_americanIndian,\nfedRace_asian,\nfedRace_blackOrAfricanAmerican,\nfedRace_pacificIslander,\nfedRace_whiteHispanic_Latinostudent_hispanicEthnicityHome_Languageident_homePrimaryLanguageELL_Statusell_statusFRL_Status IEP_Status Student_StreetmailingAddress_addressLine1Student_CitymailingAddress_cityStudent_StatemailingAddress_stateStudent_ZipmailingAddress_zipStudent_Emailpcontact_emailUsername Password Unweighted_GPAgpa_cumGpaUnweightedWeighted_GPAgpa_cumGpaBasic\n\n\n \n\n\nTEACHERS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDsch_schoolGUIDTeacher_IDindividual_personIDTeacher_Numberindividual_staffNumberState_Teacher_ID Teacher_Emailpcontact_emailFirst_Nameindividual_firstNameMiddle_Name Last_Nameindividual_lastNameTitleschoolEmployment_titleUsername Password \n\n\n \n\n\nSECTIONS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDsch_schoolGUIDSection_IDsectionInfo_sectionIDTeacher_IDsectionInfo_teacherPersonIDTeacher_2_ID, Teacher_3 ID,\netc.sectionInfo_teacher2PersonID, sectionInfo_teacher3PersonID, sectionInfo_teacher4PersonIDNameClever-generated: course_name -\nteacher_last_name -\nperiodSection_NumbercourseInfo_courseNumberGradecourseInfo_gradeCourse_NamecourseInfo_courseNameCourse_NumbercourseInfo_courseNumberCourse_DescriptioncourseInfo_descriptionPeriodsectionSchedule_periodStartSubjectAuto-populated\nby Clever using a keyword search on Course_NameTerm_Name Term_Start Term_End"

Default field mappings\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nPlease note: If you've previously set up the Skyward Qmlativ OneRoster API sync, you must upgrade to the new Integration Access\nsystem by this summer, or your sync will break. Learn more. \n\nThis doesn't apply to SMS or LMS Skyward API sync nor the Skyward Autosync.\n\n \n\n✓ Runs every six hours, by querying the Skyward API \n✓ Pulls all students and teachers who have an active school association\n✓ Supports co-teachers for sections\n✓ Supports multiple student contacts per student; these are pulled from the guardian data in Skyward\n✓ Supports custom field mappings (please contact Clever Support to set this up).\n\nPlease note: \n         •  The Skyward API doesn't sync IEP, ELL, FRL, or Home_language fields. \n         •   For student contacts we are unable to:\n               - filter contacts\n               - customize contact data\n\n \n\n\nVERSION\n\nThe minimum version for the Skyward API sync is 05.16.10.00.xx (any addendum will work)\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP THE API SYNC\n\n1. Obtain API credentials\nFinding your API credentials will differ depending on how you’re hosted. Please follow the directions below:\n \n\n 1. Secure Cloud (ISCorp) Hosted Districts: Create an IT Services service call to have ISCorp set up the Read Only API by visiting\n    the Support Center or ISCorp Helpdesk.\n 2. Managed Services / TN State Hosted Districts: Create an IT Services service call to have Skyward set up the Read Only API\n    install by visiting the Support Center.\n 3. Self-Hosted Districts: Use the API Server Launch Kit to set up the Read Only API. Optionally, districts can create an IT\n    Services service call to have Skyward set up the Read Only API as a billable service by visiting the Support Center.\n\n \n\nPlease note: When setting up Skyward API, districts must choose OA2 - OAuth 2.0. If you experience sync issues with OAuth 2.0,\nplease reach out to Clever Support for assistance.  \n\n \n\n2. Change sync type of Clever account\nIf you already have a Clever account and are switching to the API sync, please contact Clever Support. Our team will need to\nswitch your account sync type before you can move forward. If you signed up for a new account, the Skyward API sync will be the\ndefault sync type for your account and no switch needs to be made. You're free to move on to the next step!\n \n\n3. Enter API credentials in Clever\nOnce your account's sync type is the Skyward API sync, please take the credentials for the API and enter them into the Sync\nSettings page in your Clever Dashboard:\n \n\n * Web URL: API URL (does not include swagger suffix) \n * Username: Key \n * Password: Secret\n\n\n4. Sync\nPush \"Sync Now\" on the Sync Settings page to kick off the initial Skyward API sync!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSCHOOL YEAR ROLLOVER\n\nRollover behavior is dependent upon which version of the Skyward API your district is syncing from:\n\nLMS API\nOnce you complete the rollover process in your Skyward database, those changes should reflect in the Skyward API for Clever\n \n\n\nONEROSTER API\n\nThe OneRoster API requires that students be active in order to be synced through the API.\n\nOnce a school year ends, students are no longer active in the OneRoster API. This causes the synced data to no longer include\nenrollments or student files. You may see the following error in your Dashboard: \"Encountered zero students data\". \n\nOnce students and other record types are marked \"Active\" in Skyward for the next school year, the sync will resume as expected.\n\nAlternately, Clever will pull data 21 days prior to the beginning of the district's next active academic session. For example, if\nschool begins on August 22nd, Clever will pull the upcoming data on August 1st.\n\nTo preserve access for your users between school years, Clever recommends that you put your sync on pause during the summer to\nprevent deletions.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf an entire record is missing, we recommend checking the following:\n \n\nRecord Type\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nStudents\n * Student must have an Active SchoolID\n * Under Web Access, the login name and password fields need to be populated\n * 'Allow student access' must be checked\n\nTeachers\n * Teacher must have an Active SchoolID\n * Teacher must have a status of isTeacher = true or isSubstitute = true\n * PrimarySchoolID must be assigned\n\nStaff\n * Staff must have an active school association\n * Staff must have isTeacher = False\n * Title must be blank or contain one of the following key terms: \n   * Superintendent\n   * Instruction\n   * Curriculum\n   * Director\n   * Coordinator\n   * Technology\n   * Coach\n   * Counselor\n   * Admin\n\nSections\n * Is the Skyward instance on version 05.16.10.00.xx or newer?\n\n\nIf the record (student, teacher, section) is in Clever but data is missing or incorrect for the record (i.e. incorrect email,\nmissing username), navigate to the Sync > Settings page in your Clever Dashboard. Under Sync Controls, click on View field\nmappings.\n\nHere you can view which fields Clever is pulling for each record and field. In the below example: \n \n\n 1. If a teacher's email address was incorrect, confirm the email is correct in the \"StaffMember_Email\" field in Skyward\n 2. If a teacher is missing State_teacher_id, you will see that Clever is not currently pulling this data. Please contact Clever\n    Support to see what options may be available to pull this data. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNC ERRORS\n\nBelow you can find solutions to common sync errors that may display in your Clever Dashboard. \n\n \n\nError Message:\n\nSolution:\n\n503 errorIf a Skyward API sync fails during this time, push another sync using the Sync Now button (Sync Settings page) after 6am\nPT and the 503 error should resolve itself.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSPECIAL CHARACTERS\n\nThe Skyward API Sync cannot sync data resources that contain forward slashes /, ampersands & , or hashes # in the ID value. If\nthese special characters are present in any of the school ID or section ID records, the Auto Sync will fail. You will see an error\non the Sync page of the Dashboard.\n\n\nIf you have any additional questions please feel free to open a support request and our team will be glad to help further!\n\n\n\nDEFAULT FIELD MAPPINGS\n\nBelow are the default field mappings for Skyward API syncs that are managed by Clever. Please note:\n\n * If a field is blank, the field is either not pulled by default, or not accessible to Clever.\n * If you want to change a field mapping or customize field mappings, please contact Clever Support to learn what options are\n   available. \n * If a field is not coming through with the correct value, Clever Support may need to complete a value mapping.

Default field mappings\n\n \n\n\nSETTING UP YOUR AERIES AUTO SYNC\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nClever allows the student data in Aeries to automatically sync with authorized\napplications. This eliminates the need for manual CSV transfers or complicated SFTP\nuploads.\n\n\nTo allow the data sync to happen, Clever needs to be able to access the Aeries\nAPI. The best practice when using Clever is to create a new Aeries API certificate for\nthe Clever sync.\n\n\n\nCREATE AN API CERTIFICATE FOR CLEVER\n\n1. Log into your Aeries administrator account for the current school year.\n2. Select Security > API Security from the menu on the left.\n3. Add a new certificate named Clever.\n4. Grant read permissions to the following items in the Student Data and Scheduling tables:\n\n * Student Data\n * Special Programs\n * Contacts, Class Schedules/History\n * Enrollment History\n * Test Scores\n * Teacher Data\n * Staff Data\n * Master Schedule\n * Course Data\n * Classes\n * Schools\n * Terms.\n\n5. Save the certificate.\n6. Click Display Certificate Details? and copy/paste your API certificate into the Sync Settings page of your Dashboard.\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAERIES AUTO SYNC FUNCTIONALITY & REQUIREMENTS \n\nFunctionality\n\n✓ Runs every four hours, by querying the Aeries API\n\n✓ Pulls all active students, teachers, and schools (“InactiveStatusCode” = blank)\n\n✓ Syncs co-teachers by pulling the TeacherNumber1, TeacherNumber2, and TeacherNumber3 fields from the Sections table\n\n✓ Supports Flex Scheduling (For schools using Flex Scheduling in Aeries, only a Staff record will be required)\n\nRequirements\n\n✓ Teachers at your district must have a Staff (STF) record in Aeries and be tied to a section to show up as a teacher in Clever.\n\n✓ For teachers, InactiveStatusCode must be blank (TCH.TG / STF.TG = blank). Any value in this field will prevent the record from\nsyncing\n\n✓ Requires your SIS to be connected to the internet\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\n * Aeries syncs can be customized to sync nightly, instead of every four hours.\n * Syncs can also be customized to pull additional fields available through the Schools, Students, Courses, Sections, Staff, or\n   Teachers tables.\n * Clever can filter exports from Aeries to limit the schools included in the sync.\n * Some districts create schools without master schedules - or schedule students without placing them in sections (typically\n   elementary schools).  Because Clever requires sections to process data, our system can automatically create sections for these\n   students based on their teacher. Please submit a request to Clever Support with a list of your schools (name and school number)\n   and we will program our system to create sections in these schools.\n * To request customizations or filtering for your Aeries sync, request assistance from Clever Support.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSCHOOL YEAR ROLLOVER\n\nClever will begin syncing new school year data when summer school ends and the Sections (SEC) and MasterSchedule (MST) tables are\nactive and available. To activate these tables, schedules must be copied over (Scheduling Process > Functions > Copy Scheduling\nResults to SEC & MST).\n\nAdditionally, Clever filters out inactive enrollments. We use the enrollment's “DateEnded” field from the Aeries API to determine\nif an enrollment is expired, or inactive. An enrollment is considered inactive if the current date is one day past the \"DateEnded\"\ndate. Of note, a section with no active enrollments on the Aeries API will appear on Sync > Last Attempted Sync page as an error,\nand will not successfully sync to your Clever instance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\n\nMISSING RECORDS\n\nIf an entire record is missing, we recommend checking the following:\n \n\nRecord Type\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n Student\n * Must have InactiveStatusCode set to null (STU.TG = blank). Any value in this field will prevent the record from syncing. \n\n TeacherTeachers at your district must have a Staff (STF) record in Aeries and be tied to a section to show up as a teacher in\nClever.     \n\n * InactiveStatusCode must be blank (any value in this field will prevent record from syncing)\n\n * Must have all required fields on the teachers/staff table\n\n * Make sure the records don't have a \"Leave Date\"\n\nPlease note, any non-teaching staff that are assigned to sections in Aeries will automatically be associated with the Default\nDistrict Office entity in Clever. They will still be connected to all associated sections, regardless of their primary school\ndesignation in Clever.\n\n Staff\n * Clever does not automatically sync records from Aeries to the Staff role in Clever.\n\nThere may be users such as administrators, secretaries, and para-professionals who might not use Aeries directly but need access\nto applications through Clever. If those users are missing from your Clever data, there are two options to sync them to Clever.\n\nOption A) Sync as teacher\n\nTo sync the user as a teacher, assign them to a section.\n\nOption B) Manually add to Clever using Custom Data\n\nIf the user requires access to teacher features or will need to be connected to a section, add the user as a Custom Teacher. \n\nIf the user does not require teacher features and only will be using Clever for Single Sign-On (SSO), add the user as Custom\nStaff. \n\n Sections\n *  In order for a section to sync the school must have a master schedule. If a school does not use master schedules, Clever can\n   auto-generate sections based on teacher/student assignments. Contact Clever Support if you would like this feature enabled. \n * A section with no active enrollments will not sync to Clever. We use the enrollment's “DateEnded” field from the Aeries API to\n   determine if an enrollment is expired, or inactive. An enrollment is considered inactive if the current date is one day past\n   the \"DateEnded\" date.\n\n \n\nIncorrect Records\n\nIf the record (student, teacher, section) is in Clever but data is missing or incorrect for the record (i.e. incorrect email,\nmissing username), navigate to the Sync > Settings page in your Clever Dashboard. Under Sync Controls, click on View defaults\n\n\nHere you can view which fields Clever is pulling for each record and field. In the below example: \n\n 1. If a student's email address was incorrect, confirm the email is correct in the \"STU.SEM\" field in Aeries.\n 2. If a student is missing FRL_status, you will see that Clever does not pull this data by default. Please contact Clever Support\n    to see what options may be available to pull this data. \n\n\n\n\n\nSome additional common errors are: \n\n \n\nRecord Type\n\nError\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nStudentsIncorrect GradeIf a student's grade is not correct in Clever, please contact Clever Support and provide the grade\ndesignation in Aeries and desired value in Clever. Our team will update your configuration to translate the value\naccurately.  StudentsMissing demographic dataIf your account is missing ELL_status, FRL_status, or IEP_status, please contact\nClever Support. Our team can enable export of these fields. TeachersIncorrect EmailThe email must be correct in the following\nthree locations:\n- the Teacher table\n- the Staff table\n- the Security Table/User Record (UGN Table)SectionsMissing SectionsSchools must be on a MasterSchedule for sections to export to\nClever. \n\nIf a school does not use MasterSchedule, please contact Clever Support and provide the site's SchoolCode (LOC.CD) so Clever can\ngenerate sections for the school. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDEFAULT FIELD MAPPINGS\n\nBelow are the default field mappings for Aeries syncs that are managed by Clever. Please note:\n\n * If a field is blank, the field is either not pulled by default, or not accessible to Clever.\n * If you want to change a field mapping, please contact Clever Support to learn what options are available. \n * If a field is not coming through with the correct value, Clever Support may need to complete a value mapping.

Upgrading to Skyward Qmlativ OneRoster API sync\n     • Steps in Clever\n     • Steps in Skyward\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSkyward is introducing a new Integration Access system for the Qmlativ OneRoster API sync, and all Clever districts using this\nsync type must transition. This new system provides more safeguards around API data access, among other benefits.\n\nThis is only for Skyward Qmlativ OneRoster API sync: if you use any other Skyward sync type, you don't need to take any action.\n\n \n\nWhen your school district switches to the new system, you must regenerate the key/secret from your Skyward dashboard and update it\nin Clever.\n\nIMPORTANT \nTo prevent your sync from breaking, you must complete this transition by this summer (exact date is TBD by Skyward).\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nUPGRADING TO SKYWARD QMLATIV ONEROSTER API SYNC\n\nTo upgrade to the Skyward Integration Access system for your existing Skyward Qmlativ OneRoster API sync, follow these steps.\n \n\n\nSTEPS IN CLEVER:\n\n 1. Go to your Clever Dashboard > Sync page > settings tab.\n\n 2. In the banner, click Upgrade.\n\n\n\n 3. You’ll need to provide refreshed/new Skyward integration access credentials (obtained from Skyward as outlined in the next\n    section):\n    \n    1. Base URL (this should remain the same)\n    \n    2. Client ID (this is the Key in Skyward)\n    \n    3. New Client Secret (this is the Secret in Skyward)\n\n\n\n 4. Click Confirm and upgrade.\n\n 5. Click on Sync to initiate a new sync.\n\n \n\n\nSTEPS IN SKYWARD:\n\n 1. Log into your Skyward account (you need read/write API > integration Access).\n 2. Access the menu by clicking on the three vertical lines in the upper left.\n 3. Click on API > Integration Access.\n\n\n\n 4. On the next page, click Add Integration Access.\n\n\n\n 5. On the Integration Access page, you’ll need to fill out the following:\n    \n    1. Name: This can be whatever you want (e.g., Clever).\n    \n    2. Integration: When you click on this box, options will appear. Select Clever as the Vendor Name with Clever OneRoster as the\n       Product Name.\n    \n    3. Key: This can be whatever you want and is similar to a username. Please make sure that this key is different from your\n       current sync’s API key so that we can verify that data is being pulled exclusively from the Integration Access system.\n    \n    4. Authentication Type: Choose OAuth 2.0.\n    \n    5. Make sure Is Active is checked.\n    \n    6. Effective Date: Choose a date when you want this to be active.\n    \n    7. Expiration Date: Choose a date when you no longer want this to be active (this can be many years in the future).\n    \n    8. OneRoster Configuration: This is where you can set up your OneRoster Configuration giving you a greater sense of control\n       and stewardship over your data and how it is utilized.\n    \n    9. There is no need to fill out the Description.\n 6. Click Save in the upper left corner.\n\n\n\n 7. Once the request has processed successfully, click Generate Secret. \n\n\n\nThis will generate an encrypted password for your Skyward account. Once generated, you’ll see your integration access details, the\nkey, and the secret. Be sure to copy these details as you’ll need to update them on the Sync > Settings page of your Clever\nDashboard as outlined in the section above.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT \nYou must copy the Key and Secret because the info isn't retrievable once you close this page. When copying the secret, please be\nsure to only copy the value of the secret. Do not include the word \"Secret:.\"\n\n\n 8. Click Run Process.\n 9. Now, you can use the new Key and Secret and update the new Integration Access system on the Sync page on your Clever\n    Dashboard. Your base URL should be the same. \n\nPlease note: If you need to regenerate a new Secret in Skyward, click the arrow next to the Clever integration on the API:\nIntegration Access List page.\n\n\n\n \n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Skyward API Sync\n * Skyward: Sync Comparison\n * Skyward Auto Sync"

(e.g. all students, teachers\n   and staff or only a subset of users, etc.)?\n * Which Clever resources do district users need to access or utilize over the summer?\n * Will your district need to add new users over the summer or before the start of the new school year?\n * Will data need to be dynamically updated in Clever via your student information system (SIS) sync, or will a Clever admin be\n   managing the manual summer school updates in Clever?\n * If you're using Clever IDM, please also review Clever IDM: Summer rollover.\n\nPlease review the rest of this article to learn of the options available to you based on your district's needs during the summer\nmonths! For specific details about school year rollover, please visit this article.\n \n\nIMPORTANT \nFor 2024, Clever automatically pauses syncs on May 31 and removes pauses between July 29 and August 2 unless you specify\notherwise. You can modify these dates (or remove them altogether) under Clever Dashboard > Sync > Sync Settings.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIF YOU CHOOSE TO PAUSE YOUR SIS DATA SYNC (RECOMMENDED)\n\nFor 2024, Clever automatically pauses syncs on May 31 and removes pauses between July 29 and August 2 unless you specify\notherwise. You can modify these dates (or remove them altogether) under your Sync > Sync Settings page. You can modify these dates\n(or remove them altogether) under your Sync > Sync Settings page.\n\nDuring the pause, Clever will stop processing data updates. This allows districts to make changes to their student information\nsystem (SIS) data or CSV data files without allowing those changes to flow into Clever and interrupt student, teacher, or staff\naccess to Clever or their connected applications over the summer. Current school year data will be \"frozen\" in Clever for the\nduration of the district's sync pause.  \n\n\nWe recommend using this option if:\n\n * Your district won't need to update summer rosters often and/or there are minimal changes that need to be made in Clever over\n   the summer.\n * District users need to access their connected applications and associated data from the previous school year during the summer\n   (e.g. students who need to complete summer homework in apps).\n\nThis option allows:\n\n * Clever admins to supplement existing roster data during the pause via Clever's custom data feature. Custom data can be used for\n   creating summer school sections, intervention groups, after-school programs, adding out-of-district students, and more! Custom\n   data does not overwrite data synced from the SIS, nor can data from the SIS overwrite custom data. As such, it is a perfect\n   option for summer school! Visit this article for details!\n * Clever admins to make updates for the upcoming school year in the SIS without the updates affecting Clever or applications\n   during the sync pause.\n * Clever admins to continue adjusting application sharing permissions for district-wide apps to meet application vendor needs.\n * District users to continue logging in to Clever, and connected applications, to access their data from the previous school\n   year.\n\n \n\nIf your district is moving forward with initiating a sync pause, please see this article for instructions. The next step of the\nprocess is Stage 3: Uploading custom data\n\n \n\nPlease note:  If you want to pause syncing your data to a particular application, please see this article: For Clever Admins:\nPausing your sync for a specific app.  This is a perfect tool for semester rollover and summer school, but shouldn't be confused\nwith an SIS sync pause. \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO PAUSE YOUR SIS DATA SYNC\n\nIf your district prefers to continue syncing SIS data to Clever over the summer, the first step is to Clear the sync Pause Start\nand End Dates on the Sync > Settings page. Once removed, data will continue to sync automatically for Clever-managed auto syncs or\nwhenever your district uploads CSV data files to your SFTP directory for SFTP syncs.\n\nClever admins will still be able to utilize the custom data feature in Clever to add any supplemental rostering data that is not\navailable in the SIS.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend using this option if:\n\n * Your users need access to their resources and learning applications over the summer, but not previous year/semester's\n   historical data.\n * You anticipate a large number of students entering your district over the summer will need access to Clever before the new\n   school year and prefer their accounts to be created directly from your SIS sync instead of manually uploading the students\n   using custom data.\n * Your summer school data changes often in your SIS, and you would like a more automated process for updating Clever.\n\nThis option allows:\n\n * Clever admins to create and manage custom rostering data in Clever.\n * Clever admins to continue adjusting application sharing permissions for district-wide apps.\n * Your district's SIS to continue dynamically updating Clever with ongoing rostering updates daily.\n * New students, teachers, sections, and staff to be added to Clever via the SIS sync. This data will continue to be synced to\n   connected applications.\n   * Please note: Some application(s) stop syncing to Clever over the summer. Please reach out to the app partner(s) directly to\n     understand their summer rollover process.\n\n \n\nImportant things to consider:\n\n * Access for students and teachers between school years may be impacted as the data in Clever is updated over the summer via the\n   SIS sync. Therefore, the content that is available to them in their applications, or their ability to access applications,\n   might change.\n   * For example:\n     * If a student's grade is updated from 4 to 5, depending on the application, they may no longer have access to their\n       4th-grade data.\n     * A teacher may not be able to access their rosters from the previous school year.\n * For more detailed information about how this might affect your connected applications, please reach out to the app support\n   teams directly.\n\n \n\nThe next step of the process is Stage 3: Uploading custom data\n \n\nIMPORTANT \nIf you do not pause your SIS data sync over the summer, any new rostering data in your SIS will replace the previous school year's\ndata in Clever. This means that students and teachers who are not attending summer school may lose access to Clever and their\nconnected applications over the summer!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nROLLOVER DATE\n\nIn Clever, the rollover date marks the transition of district data from the previous school year to the upcoming one. This usually\noccurs during the summer when the data for the upcoming school year is live but before the first day of school. District admins\nwill be prompted to choose the rollover date upon removing the 'Pause Start Date' and 'Pause End Date' in the Clever Dashboard >\nSync > Settings. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIt's important to mark the new school year rollover date in Clever as it enables us to guarantee the seamless functioning of your\napplications. This proactive approach ensures that your Clever account is fully primed and operational for the upcoming school\nyear!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n\nCAN WE PAUSE DATA SYNCS TO SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS?\n\n * You can pause syncing data to any app using App Sync Pause.\n * The SIS sync pause in Clever essentially freezes all data in Clever, so the data synced to all connected applications will\n   remain the same over the summer if your SIS sync is paused.\n\n\n \n\n\nHOW DOES CLEVER DETERMINE THE PRIMARY LOCATION FOR A USER? \n\n * By default, Clever assigns users' primary schools where the majority of their sections are located. For more details on this\n   logic, please see this article.\n\n \n\n\nWHAT IF WE ARE SWITCHING OUR DISTRICT'S SIS, SYNC TYPE, OR SIS IDS OVER THE SUMMER?\n\n * Please contact Clever support if you are planning on changing any of this information! We highly encourage districts to not\n   change SIS IDs for data types (excluding sections) because historical data is tied with SIS IDs which will impact all connected\n   district applications.\n * For details on changing our SIS, sync type, or SIS IDs, please see this article. \n\n \n\n\nWHEN CAN I ENTER NEW SCHOOL YEAR DATES FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR?\n\n * The school year dates will be updated to the following school year in mid-summer. The start and end dates need to be entered by\n   a Clever admin in the School Year Dates section on the Sync page under the settings tab.\n\n\n\nHowever, there's no need for schools to worry about setting these dates until closer to the start of the next school year. \n\n\n\nThe next step of the process is Stage 3: Creating data"

Teachers at multiple school sites\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThere are a number of errors that may surface on your Last attempted sync page related to individual data types. For example, you\nmay see users fail to sync to Clever due to the use of duplicate IDs.\n \n\nClever requires a unique ID for every record we process, and each data type contains at least one unique record ID field value:\n'School_id', 'Teacher_id', 'Section_id', or 'Student_id'. If two or more records share an ID value, Clever will only process the\nfirst record with that ID. The following error will be surfaced: invalid 'section_id (school_id, teacher_id, student_id)' due to\nerror 'not unique'\n \n\nThese unique IDs are used to make connections between data types and therefore need to be unique and consistent across all 5\nfiles. For example, a school record in your ‘schools.csv’ file with 'School_id' “12345” should be identified as “12345” for each\nstudent attending that school in the ‘students.csv’ file.\n \n\n\nHOW TO TROUBLESHOOT THIS ERROR\n\n 1. Visit the Sync Report in your Dashboard for detailed information about data that Clever was unable to process.\n     \n 2. Click \"Download Changes\" to download a list of records affected by this error.\n    \n    \n 3. Correct these errors in your uploads by determining a truly unique identifier for all records, or filter the data before you\n    upload to Clever.\n\nPlease see this video for a tutorial on troubleshooting duplicate IDs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEACHERS AT MULTIPLE SCHOOL SITES\n\n\nTo avoid receiving this duplicate ID error, teachers at multiple school sites should still only be listed once in the teachers.csv\nfile with one school_id as their primary school. However, they can then be associated with sections from multiple schools in the\nsections.csv file.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\n * Sync Reports: Error messages \n * Sync Report error: Sections not processed due to missing students\n * Sync Report error: Records not processed due to missing school"

How can I ensure Clever chooses the correct subject?\n5. Miscategorized Subjects\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSyncing subjects accurately is essential to getting the most out of Clever. Many learning applications require sections to have\nsubjects, and assigning subjects correctly will also make it easier to share data by sections. This article outlines how Clever\ndetermines ‘subject’ for each section and how to sync ‘subject’ with Clever to ensure accuracy.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DOES CLEVER DETERMINE ‘SUBJECT’?\n\nIf your data sync includes a ‘subject’ field, Clever categorizes sections into subject categories based on the values you provide.\nFor example, ‘subject’ field values “English”, “Reading”, and “Writing” are all sorted into “english/language arts”. Everything\nthat can’t be sorted (including blanks) will be assigned to the subject “other”.\n\nAll sections will be assigned one of the following subject values:\n\n * arts and music\n * english/language arts\n * homeroom/advisory\n * interventions/online learning\n * language\n * math\n * PE and health\n * science\n * social studies\n * technology and engineering\n * other \n\nIf Clever can't determine the subject based on the values given in the 'subject' field, then our system looks to values in\nthe section 'name' field, and lastly, to values in the course_name field.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT IF MY SYNC DOESN’T INCLUDE A SUBJECT FIELD?\n\nIf you aren’t syncing a ‘subject’ field, Clever categorizes sections into the subject categories above based on what terms are\nincluded in the ‘section_name’ field. For example, sections with section_name values of “Algebra II Honors 3A”, “5th Grade\nMathematics”, and “P4 - Calc - Johnson” are all assigned the subject “math”.\n\nIf Clever can’t determine the subject based on section 'name’, Clever will look at the ‘course_name’ field for terms that indicate\nsubject.\n\nAny section whose subject cannot be determined will be assigned the subject “other”.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW CAN I ENSURE CLEVER CHOOSES THE CORRECT SUBJECT?\n\nThere are two ways to make sure Clever chooses the right subject for each section:\n\n1. Add ‘subject’ field to your sync\n\nSyncing a ‘subject’ field to Clever with values that exactly match the subject categories listed above is the best way to make\nsure subjects are accurate in Clever. As long as you provide one of Clever’s accepted subject values, Clever will use the exact\nvalue you provide.\n\nIf you’re syncing data with Clever via Auto Sync, you’ll want to determine which field is used to sync subjects to Clever, then\npopulate that field with the above subject values.\n\n * If you’re using a Clever-Managed Auto Sync, contact Clever Support to determine which SIS field is used for subject. You can\n   also tell us if you’d prefer to pull a different subject field from your SIS.\n * For SIS-Managed Auto Syncs, please reach out directly to your SIS to determine which fields can be used to send subject values\n   to Clever.\n\nFor SFTP Syncs, add a column with header “Subject” and include a value for each section that exactly matches one of the subject\ncategories listed above.\n\n2. Change the value of section ‘name’ or ‘course_name’\n\nIf you’re not able to sync a ‘subject’ field to Clever, we will make our best guess based on the terms included in the section\n‘name’ and ‘course_name’ fields. To improve accuracy, try some of these tips:\n\n * Include one of Clever’s subject values in your section or course names.\n * Use full terms whenever possible. For example, “comp” is interpreted as “composition” (subject: “english/language arts”), not\n   “computers” (subject: “technology and engineering”).\n * Creative names can sometimes be miscategorized, so opt for simple and commonly used terms. For example, “astronomy” gets\n   matched to “science”, whereas “rocket ships” would be matched to “other”.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMISCATEGORIZED SUBJECTS\n\nClever makes the best-educated guess to sort each section into the above subjects. If you see a large number of sections assigned\nthe wrong subject value, please request help from our Support Team."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. How to add a substitute\n3. How subs log in to Clever\n4. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nA common piece of feedback we’ve heard from substitute teachers is that they often aren’t given any access to edtech programs,\nmaking it hard for them to support students.\n\n\nGood news! You can use Clever to give both long-term and short-term substitute teachers access to Clever and your district’s\nedtech programs. \n\nThis enables them to support students in ways such as:\n\n * Troubleshooting logins for students using Clever\n * Creating or viewing Teacher Pages\n * Messaging students in Clever\n * Launching apps and logging students out of Clever\n * Accessing edtech programs to check on student progress and offer support\n\n \n\nPlease note: Please remember that, like any user added via Clever, subs who access Clever may count towards your license caps for\nyour edtech programs. This varies considerably from app to app, as some apps might offer an unlimited school or district license\nwhile others charge per user. If you’re unsure if adding subs will affect any app subscriptions, please check in with the app\ndirectly.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO ADD A SUBSTITUTE\n\n\n\nSHORT TERM SUBSTITUTES\n\nFor a substitute covering a class last minute or for less than one week, we recommend the following steps.\n \n\n 1. If the substitute teacher works in your district regularly and already has a Clever teacher account, please proceed to step\n    two. If the substitute teacher doesn't work for your district as a regular teacher, or if they are only a staff user in\n    Clever, you’ll add them as a custom teacher in Clever. When adding them as a custom teacher, you can set a predetermined date\n    when they’ll lose access (which you can update as needed). If you add a predetermined date when they lose access, you’ll have\n    to re-add the sub if they ever come back to your school to sub again. Note: Please wait 15 minutes after adding the custom\n    teacher before moving to step two; this allows the custom teacher to sync across Clever.\n    \n     \n 2. Add the teacher as a co-teacher to all of the sections they will be substituting for. This will give them access to those\n    sections in Clever, along with most edtech apps that support co-teachers. Some edtech programs don’t support co-teachers, so\n    please check with any critical programs directly.\n\n\n\nPlease note: For the teacher to log in, they must have an email that matches the Identity Provider (IDP) your district has set up.\nFor example, if you have Google as your IDP, the teacher must have a Gmail address (either personal or provided by your district).\nAlternatively, you can add Clever Passwords  as an IDP, which subs access via a username and password (and doesn’t require a\nspecific email address/provider).\n\n 3. Inform the substitute. You can share this article with them, which runs through how Clever works for teachers and how they can\n    access it. \n\nPlease note: While the sub can log into Clever around 15 minutes after you’ve added them, it may take up to 24 hours for them to\nbe shared with all apps (this sync typically occurs on a nightly basis). If it’s been more than 24 hours and the sub does not have\naccess to an application, we suggest contacting the app(s) in question or Clever Support.\n\n\n \n \n\nLONG TERM SUBSTITUTES\n\nFor a substitute covering a class longer-term (such as parental leave), we recommend the following steps.\n\nOption 1: Add them as a teacher via your Student Information System (SIS):\n\nThis option is ideal, as it automatically creates their account in Clever, and shares them with the section(s) they’ll be teaching\nin any connected apps.\n\n 1. If possible, have the teacher added as the teacher of record in your Student Information System (SIS), and add them as the\n    teacher for the sections they’ll be covering. We also recommend providing them a district email address as this is often a\n    requirement for your connected apps and will help the sub to access Clever. \n    * Note: If adding them as the teacher of record isn’t possible, you can also add them as a co-teacher. Some edtech programs\n      don’t support co-teachers, so please check with any critical programs directly.\n 2. If you’re able to follow step one, this teacher will automatically be added to Clever and provided access to the sections\n    you’ve added them to, along with any edtech programs those sections are shared with. As such, they’ll have access to Clever\n    and edtech programs in the same way as any other district teacher.\n 3. Inform the substitute that they have a Clever account and a district email account. You can share this article with them,\n    which runs through how Clever works for teachers and how they can access it. \n\n\nOption 2: Add them as a custom teacher in Clever\n\nIf you add the sub as a custom teacher, you’ll have to take more manual steps than with option one.\n\n 1. If option one isn’t viable, you can add the long-term sub as a custom teacher in Clever. Note: Please wait 15 minutes after\n    adding the custom teacher before moving to step two; this allows the custom teacher to sync across Clever.\n 2. Add them as a co-teacher for all the sections they’ll be teaching.\n\n\n 3. Inform the substitute that they have a Clever account. You can share this article with them, which runs through how Clever\n    works and how they can access it.\n     \n\nPlease note: While the sub can log into Clever around 15 minutes after you’ve added them, it may take up to 24 hours for them to\nbe shared with all apps (this sync typically occurs on a nightly basis). If it’s been more than 24 hours and the sub is not\nshowing up, we suggest contacting the app(s) in question or Clever Support.\n\n   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW SUBS LOG IN TO CLEVER\n\n\nSUBS WITH DISTRICT EMAIL ADDRESSES \n\nIf the sub has a district email address, they can sign in using that email on your district’s Clever URL (such as\nClever.com/in/district-nickname). If your district uses Clever Passwords as your Identity Provider (IdP), the teacher will use the\nusername/password configuration you’ve determined for signing in (you can check that here if you’re not sure).\n\n\n \nSUBS WITHOUT DISTRICT EMAIL ADDRESSES \n\nIf the sub doesn't have a district email address, they can sign in using a personal Google email account if your district uses\nGoogle as an Identity Provider. Just be sure to use their Google email address when creating their account.\n\nIf the sub does not have a district email address, and your district doesn’t use Google as an Identity Provider, the sub will need\nto sign in via Clever Passwords. You can add this as an Identity Provider here.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nCan you provide substitutes with access for a specific date range?\n\n * Yes! When adding the sub as a Custom Teacher, you can determine a date for them to lose access. Learn more about custom\n   teachers here.\n\n\nWill subs have access to Teacher Pages?\n\n * Subs will have access to build their own Teacher Pages, whether they’re a regular teacher created via your SIS or a custom\n   teacher. If the teacher the sub is covering for has Teacher Page(s), that teacher can also share their Teacher Page with the\n   sub. You can find out more about sharing Teacher Pages here."

Sharing sensitive data with applications\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever can sync a variety of demographic data, such as  ELL status, IEP status, and Free/reduced-price lunch (FRL) status, among\nothers. Because the data in these fields is considered sensitive, Clever doesn't automatically share this data with any\ndistrict-connected applications. Still, these fields can be included in the application sharing if needed. \n\nClever Tip: Not all apps support all demographic data/sensitive fields. If you have specific demographic data you need to share\nwith an app, please contact the app directly to check if they support syncing that field.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSYNCING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA/SENSITIVE FIELDS TO CLEVER\n\nThe first step is to ensure that sensitive fields are synced to Clever. Please navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Data browser >\nStudents tab to verify if these data points are available. Use the filter option to filter students by the demographic field in\nquestion. Then, select the value drop-down menu. If this search is not available, it likely means the data is not in Clever, and\ntherefore, you can't search using these fields. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS\n\nDistricts that utilize the Clever-managed auto-sync can customize their sync from the Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings > View\nField Mappings > Students tab. If the SIS field you wish to export is not available in the dropdown, please contact Clever Support\nfor assistance.\n\nPlease note: OneRoster API syncs cannot sync ell_status, frl_status, and iep_status. They can be manually uploaded via Custom\ndata. Visit this article for instructions. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSIS-MANAGED AUTO AND SFTP SYNCS\n\nDistricts that utilize an SIS-managed SFTP Auto Sync or an SFTP sync will need to contact their SIS, or whoever configured the\nSFTP export, directly to begin syncing these data points to Clever. This data will need to be added to the students.csv export for\nthe district with the column headers:\n\n * ell_status\n * iep_status\n * frl_status\n * preferred_last_name\n * preferred_middle_name\n * preferred_first_name \n * gifted status\n * home_language (see this section for a list of available languages)\n * section_504_status\n * disability_status \n * disability_type (see here for a list of possible disability types)\n\nPlease also review Clever's general SFTP guidelines here. These instructions contain information about Clever-supported column\nheaders and formatting requirements.\n\n \n\n\nSUPPORTED HOME LANGUAGES\n\nCheck out this article for all of the possible options for home languages. Given the number of languages supported, this list is\nnot included in our general SFTP guidelines.\n\nWhen designating the home language within the students.csv file, you can use either the home language or the home language code.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSHARING SENSITIVE DATA WITH APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nSHARING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA/SENSITIVE FIELDS WITH APPLICATIONS\n\nYou can locate the Field Access information by navigating to a specific application's overview page from your Clever Dashboard and\nchoosing the application Settings tab. Currently, Field Access gives you an overview of the data your applications have indicated\nthey are using. Each learning application partner configures its required/optional fields for district data. Please get in touch\nwith the application support teams directly if you have questions.\n\nSelect the Advanced settings option, and then Customize fields shared with. You can customize the student data available to the\napplication from the Edit Student Fields tab. \n\n\n\n * The list on the left shows the fields available to share with the application. \n * The list on the right shows the list of fields currently being shared with the application. \n\nMove field(s) from the left to right to share the sensitive data with the application. Once your changes have been made, select\nNext and Save. The application should be synced the newly shared data within the next 24 hours.\n\nSetting up sharing rules to share data based on demographic data/sensitive field information\n\nBy configuring application sharing permissions, districts can determine what data they would like to make available to\napplications. Sharing permissions also help districts to determine which users (e.g., teachers, students, staff) will have access\nto different applications in their Clever Portals.\n\nCustom sharing rules allow districts to share only data that meets certain criteria. Once the field data has been synced to Clever\nand is available in the Clever Dashboard, sharing rules can be configured to share by the data associated with fields. For\nexample:\n\n * Share only students whose ELL_Status is 'Y'\n * Share only students whose gifted_status is 'N'\n\nConfiguring sharing rules to share using field data is completed by creating a sharing rule to 'Custom share by student.' From\nthere, districts can select the field they would like to use for sharing data. Please visit Sharing Permissions: Share by\nRules for more information about setting up sharing rules.\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules"

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will help to explain how you can import term data to Clever, how to view it, and how you can use it!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW ARE TERMS CREATED?\n\nTerm data is synced to Clever from your SIS as part of your section data. Term data is not required by Clever, but it may be\nrequired by certain applications.\nThe fields associated with term data are: \n\n * Term_name\n * Term_start\n * Term_end\n\nFor most Clever-managed auto syncs, term data is included by default. If your Clever-managed auto sync does not include term data,\nplease contact Clever Support to discuss what options are available for your sync type.\n\nClever auto-generates a unique Clever ID for each term based on term_start, term_end, and term_name. If any of those values\nchange, a new term Clever ID will be generated which could affect term data in some connected applications. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVIEWING TERM DATA IN THE DATA BROWSER\n\nTo view the terms data that has synced to Clever, you can go to the Data Browser and look at the Terms tab. \n\n\n\nThe Terms tab includes the term name, the start and end dates, the Clever ID of the term, when it was created, when it was last\nmodified, and a link to the Sections tab.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW IS TERM DATA USED?\n\nTerm data can be used to share with applications. When constructing sharing rules, you can Custom Share by Section when Sharing by\nRules. You can use this sharing type to filter by section attributes such as subject, school, course, and term. For more\ninformation on this, please see Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules. This will allow you to share your data with an application by\ncertain terms. As an example, you can see below there is a sections sharing rule that has been set up to share sections with a\nspecific term. This will share sections that are associated with the Spring 2022 term.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nCan I side-load term data?\n\n * No, it is not possible to manually upload term data (term_name, term_start, term_end) for sections. For SFTP syncing districts\n   or schools that are unable to export term data in their sections.csv, we recommend manually updating the sections.csv file to\n   include term data and to update/upload their sections.csv on a regular cadence (i.e. every week) \n\nSince section data is relatively static (student enrollments can change without any section data (name, course, period, etc.),\nschools will only need to manually update and upload their sections.csv when sections are added or removed from their school's\nSIS. \n\nWhat if our Student Information System doesn’t sync term data?\n\n * If you have a Clever-managed auto sync, you can contact Clever support to see if your sync type can be customized to pull term\n   data.\n * If your sync type doesn’t allow for the syncing of term data, we can discuss changing you to a sync type that does allow for\n   this data to be synced. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated Articles: \n\n * For District Admins: Sync Reports\n * Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules"

Course data is not\nrequired by Clever, but it may be required by certain applications. The fields associated with courses are: \n\n * Course_name\n * Course_number\n * Course_description\n\nClever auto-generates a unique Clever ID for each course, based on the  course_number and course_name fields. This value is\ndistinct to the course and is different than a section Clever ID. The course Clever ID is used to identify unique courses within\nyour data and is used for content mapping . \n\nSince we use the course_number and course_name fields to generate the course ID, any changes to the values in those fields will\nauto-generate a new course Clever ID. If a Clever ID for a course is regenerated, it will require updating the content mappings\nfor any applications that use the content mapping feature.\n\nUnfortunately, Clever is unable to revert to any previous values of this number, since the IDs are auto-generated and old IDs are\nauto-deprecated when changed, as they behave just like a Clever ID.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVIEWING COURSES IN THE DATA BROWSER\n\nTo view the course data that has synced to Clever, you can go to the Data Browser and look at the Courses tab. \n\n\n\nThe Courses tab includes the course number, the course name, the Clever ID of the course, a link to sections related to the\ncourse, and when that course was last modified. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW IS COURSE DATA USED?\n\nCourse data can be used to share with applications.

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Changing Clever IDs\n3. Clever ID Retention Policy\n\n\n\nClever ID refers to the globally unique identifier that is assigned to a record in Clever. This value is important as it ensures\nthat every student, teacher, section, etc. on Clever has a unique ID across all active schools on Clever. Since it is globally\nunique, most application partners use the Clever ID as the primary identifier for a record when pulling data from Clever. \n\nClever IDs are an alpha-numeric string that is generated by Clever and can be viewed on the profile page for a record. \n\nClever IDs are directly connected to the following primary ids provided by the district to Clever. For more information on\nClever's field specifications, please see this document.\n \n\nRecord Type\n\nPrimary ID Field\n\nSchoolSchool_idStaffStaff_idTeacherTeacher_idStudentStudent_idSectionSection_id\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nCHANGING CLEVER IDS\n\nChanges in Clever IDs are the result of the primary id field for the record being changed. If the primary id field is changed for\na record, a new Clever ID will be provisioned. For example: \n\nIF\n             Student A is uploaded from the SIS to Clever with Student_id: 1234.\nTHEN\n             A new student record with Student_id: 1234 / Clever ID: 53446ae050bb279fb03d2a3e is created.\n\nIF\n             Student A is updated in the SIS and uploaded from the SIS to Clever with Student_id: 5678.\nTHEN\n             Student record with Student_id: 1234 / Clever ID: 53446ae050bb279fb03d2a3e is deleted.          \n             A new student record with Student_id: 5678 / Clever ID: 54d263946cc968010000007a is created.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nCLEVER ID RETENTION POLICY\n\nClever retains the relationship between a primary id and Clever ID for 300 days.\n\nFor example, if a student is deleted from Clever and added back within 300 days, the student will be assigned the same Clever ID.\nIf a student is deleted from Clever and added back after 300 days, the student will be assigned a NEW Clever ID. \n\nSince applications build off the Clever ID, students that are added back within 300 days will be restored with their historical\ndata (progress, scores, etc.) Students that are added back after 300 days will have a new account provisioned in the application\nand will have no historical data. \n\nIf your district has a student population that regularly cycles between enrollment and withdrawal, Clever can extend this 300-day\nwindow to one that will preserve Clever IDs for longer. (i.e. 730 days). If interested in extending your Clever ID retention\npolicy, please submit a support request at support.clever.com."

FAQs\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThere may sometimes be discrepancies between the data in your student information system (SIS) and Clever. Issues like missing\nteacher, student, staff, or section data. Or maybe a teacher or student's primary school in Clever doesn't match what's in your\nSIS. Here is a quick guide to help you troubleshoot missing or incorrect data in Clever.\n \n\nData incorrect in app: Most applications sync with Clever daily. Please allow up to 24 hrs for newly updated or shared data in\nClever to be reflected in your connected applications.  For more information, visit: For Clever Admins: Apps - Sync times.\n\nIf the data is correct in Clever but incorrect in an app, please contact the app's support team directly. Applications are\nresponsible for syncing data from Clever. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nDepending on the type of student information system (SIS) sync you have configured with Clever, the process might be different.\nYour sync type (how your data is getting to Clever) can be found on the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard.\n \n\nSFTP sync:\n\n\n\nIf your sync type is SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), this means that Clever is receiving CSV files directly from your\nStudent Information System (SIS). The configuration and transmission of these files are managed by a contact at your district\nrather than Clever. \n\nSteps to fix data issues\n\n 1. Confirm the data is correct in your student information system (SIS).\n\n 2. Upload an updated set of data files to Clever. Please allow up to 30 minutes for the sync to complete. \n\n 3. On the Sync page, confirm your sync is not on hold or hitting a sync error.\n\n 4. Review the data files you are sending to Clever for accuracy. You can download them on the Sync > Last Attempted Sync page.\n    Learn more here!\n\n 5. If the data is incorrect in the data files, contact your SIS manager -- Clever Support cannot assist with investigating data\n    export errors.\n\n 6. If the data is correct in the data files but incorrect in Clever, please contact Clever Support.\n\nTip to fix rollover issues\n\nThe data in Clever will rollover once we receive data for the new school year and the resulting data hold has been released.\nPlease contact the sync manager at your district if you have any questions. \n\n \n\n\nSFTP (SIS-MANAGED) SYNC:\n\n\n\nIf your sync type is SFTP (SIS-managed), this means that Clever is receiving CSV files directly from your SIS. The configuration\nand transmission of these files are managed by your SIS rather than Clever. \n\n\n\nSteps to fix data issues\n\n 1. Confirm the data is correct in your student information system (SIS).\n\n 2. Contact your SIS support team to upload an updated set of data files to Clever. Please allow up to 30 minutes for the sync to\n    complete. \n\n 3. On the Sync page, confirm your sync is not on hold or hitting a sync error.\n\n 4. Review the data files you are sending to Clever for accuracy. You can download them on the Sync > Last Attempted Sync page.\n    Learn more here!\n\n 5. If the data is incorrect in the data files, contact your SIS support team -- Clever Support cannot assist with investigating\n    data export errors.\n\n 6. If the data is correct in the data files but incorrect in Clever, please contact Clever Support.\n\nTip to fix rollover issuesThe data in Clever will rollover once we receive data for the new school year and the resulting data\nhold has been released. Please contact your SIS if you have any questions. \n\n \n\n\nCLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNC:\n\n\n\nIf your sync type is Clever-Managed Auto Sync, this means that your syncs are automated daily and are primarily managed by the\nClever Support team. These syncs securely transfer rostering data from your district's student information system (SIS) to Clever.\n\nSteps to fix data issues\n\n 1. Confirm the data is correct in your student information system (SIS).\n\n 2. Navigate to the Sync > Settings page and push Sync now. Please allow up to 30 minutes for the sync to complete.\n\n 3. On the Sync page, confirm your sync is not on hold or hitting a sync error.\n\n 4. If you've confirmed the data is correct in your SIS, use the documentation for your sync type to troubleshoot the data.  \n\n * * Aeries\n   \n   * PowerSchool\n   \n   * Infinite Campus Auto\n   \n   * Infinite Campus API\n   \n   * SchoolInsight\n   \n   * Skyward Auto\n   \n   * Skyward API\n   \n   * Blackbaud API Sync\n\nTips to fix rollover issues\n * All syncs will encounter a hold when you rollover to the new school year. Please confirm the hold has been released in your\n   Clever Dashboard. \n\n * See the rollover directions for your sync type to troubleshoot issues related to rollover. \n   \n   * Aeries\n   \n   * PowerSchool\n   \n   * Infinite Campus Auto\n   \n   * Infinite Campus API\n   \n   * SchoolInsight\n   \n   * Skyward Auto\n   \n   * Blackbaud API Sync\n\nIf the above steps do not resolve your issue, please contact Clever Support.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nBelow are some common questions about incorrect data.\n\n\nWHY IS A STUDENT OR TEACHER'S PRIMARY SCHOOL WRONG IN CLEVER, BUT CORRECT IN OUR SIS?\n\n * For context, Clever dynamically updates the primary school assignment for students based on the total number of sections\n   they have at a particular school site. For example, if a student has seven sections at School A and three sections at School B,\n   their primary school would be School A in Clever. \n * If you'd rather Clever use students' primary school exactly as it's listed in your SIS, we can disable our default logic for\n   either students or teachers or both user types. Once this logic is disabled, Clever will look to your SIS data as the source of\n   truth for primary school assignments instead of the student or teacher's sections. Please note that this is a global change\n   that will affect all users of the same type in Clever and not just individual students. \n * For more information, please see this article from our Help Center: For District Admins: Primary School Assignment.\n\n\nHOW CAN A TEACHER OR STUDENT BE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE THAN ONE SCHOOL SITE?\n\n * Teachers and students can only have one primary school site in Clever. However, their additional school sites are associated\n   with their Clever account through their section data. \n\n\nWHY ARE THE SECTION NAMES IN CLEVER DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED?\n\n * Section names in Clever are auto-generated to ensure uniqueness, improving recognition and usability for teachers and students.\n   However, districts or schools can choose to sync their own section names to Clever. For more information on section names,\n   please see this article that has information on how to sync section names: For Clever Admins: Section Names\n\n\nWHY IS A STUDENT AND/OR TEACHER NOT SYNCING/SHOWING UP IN CLEVER?\n\n * If you have gone over the troubleshooting steps above and the user is still not syncing to Clever, you can reach out to Clever\n   Support. Some auto syncs have specific criteria as to what is required for certain user types to sync to Clever. \n\n\nWHY ARE SOME OF OUR SECTIONS SHOWING THE WRONG SUBJECT?\n\n * If your data sync includes a subject field, Clever categorizes sections into subject categories based on the values you\n   provide. For example, subject field values English, Reading, and Writing are all sorted into english/language arts. Everything\n   that can’t be sorted (including blanks) will be assigned to the subject other. You can find more in-depth information here: For\n   District Admins: Assigning \"subject\" to sections.\n\n\nWHY ARE MY SECTIONS NOT SYNCING TO CLEVER? \n\n * In order for section data to sync to Clever, the section must have students and a primary teacher assigned to it. \n\n\nWHY ARE CLASSES WITH MULTIPLE GRADE LEVELS IN THEM SHOWING UP AS \"OTHER\"?\n\n * Check to ensure your students are syncing to Clever with a grade associated with them, or elect a grade for the section in your\n   SIS and sync it to Clever."

How to update manually added (side-loaded) user emails\n5. Important considerations when updating user emails\n5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAs you use Clever, you may need to update your student, teacher, or staff email addresses or domains (@example.com) if you change\nthe format for user emails. Updating emails is a quick change that Clever sees as an update to user accounts. You can change any\ndata point for your users, such as their email address, grade, last name, or graduation year without any need to notify the Clever\nteam.\n\n  Please note: If you will be changing your user’s SIS IDs (such as teacher_id, student_id, or school_id), please contact Clever\nSupport.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO UPDATE USER EMAILS FOR AN SFTP OR SFTP (SIS-MANAGED) SYNC\n\nIf you utilize an SFTP or SFTP (SIS-Managed) sync, you will need to work on updating the email addresses included in the CSV files\nyou are sending to Clever.  If you manage your students.csv, teachers.csv, and staff.csv, please update the student_email,\nteacher_email, and staff_email columns to include the new email addresses for your users.  If you only update emails for one user\ntype, you only need to update that file. Once you have your updated files, you can upload them to Clever to update your user’s\nemail addresses.\n\nIf your SIS manages the sending of your CSV files to Clever on your behalf, please contact your SIS team directly for more\ninformation on updating the email addresses included in these files. Once you’ve worked with your SIS team to update the emails\nincluded in these files and they send the updated email addresses via the CSV files, the emails will update in Clever.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO UPDATE USER EMAILS FOR A CLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNC\n\nPlease review the default fields for your sync type in the article that corresponds with your sync type below:\n\n * Skyward API Sync\n\n * Skyward Auto Sync\n\n * Infinite Campus API Sync\n\n * Infinite Campus Auto Sync\n\n * Powerschool Plugin Sync\n\n * Powerschool Auto Sync\n\n * Aeries Auto Sync\n\n * Blackbaud API Sync\n\nTo update your email addresses in Clever, you will want to work to update the email addresses in the field Clever is pulling from\nyour SIS. If you have a custom mapping in place for emails, or if your sync type supports custom mappings and you’d like to\nexplore syncing emails from an alternate field in your SIS to Clever, please contact Clever Support for further assistance.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO UPDATE MANUALLY ADDED (SIDE-LOADED) USER EMAILS\n\nIf you manually manage student and teacher emails by uploading student_emails.csv and teacher_emails.csv, you’ll want to update\nthese files with the new user emails.  Once you’ve updated the email addresses for your users in each file, please upload the new\nfiles via your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Upload page. \n\n\n\nFor more information, please see our article Manually Uploading (i.e. side-loading) user emails to Clever.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS WHEN UPDATING USER EMAILS\n\n * Updating all users' accounts will likely cause a sync hold.  Once the data sync completes, you can approve the hold on your\n   Clever Dashboard > Sync page. For more information on sync holds please see our article For Clever Admins: Sync Holds.\n\n * If you use Clever Passwords as your identity provider (IdP), please check if you are using the “Email” field for your\n   usernames.  If so, you will need to reset Clever Passwords once the new emails sync. This is because Clever Passwords'\n   usernames and passwords are not updated dynamically. Click here for more information on resetting passwords.\n\n * Do you utilize SSO (Saved Passwords) applications, and if so is the \"Email\" field utilized for the username field for any Saved\n   Passwords applications?  If so, after syncing new email addresses, you may need to clear the cache if users are having issues\n   logging into those SSO (Saved Password) applications.\n\n * Do you utilize any SAML applications? If so, are you using emails to match accounts? The emails will need to match between\n   Clever and the application to ensure SAML login success.\n\n * Please notify any application partners syncing email addresses via Clever of your upcoming email changes to ensure they are\n   prepared for the changes.\n\n * If Clever Administrator, District Help Desk, or District Curriculum Lead emails are also changing, these will need to be\n   updated on the individual’s Clever Dashboard > Profile page. Each admin will need to update their own email by selecting the\n   \"Edit\" button in the \"Account information\" box on their Profile page.\n\n * Please review and update your Tech Support Contact email if required.\n\n * If you utilize Clever Identity Management (IDM):\n   \n   * If you provision Google accounts via Clever IDM, by default IDM references the SIS email field as the source of truth when\n     matching and updating accounts. Updating email addresses in Clever will cause Clever IDM to update the emails for these users\n     in Google.\n   \n   * Clever IDM for Active Directory and Entra ID by default looks first to the District Username field as a source of truth.\n     Updating user emails won't directly impact emails in Active Directory or Entra ID unless you also update the username field.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)\n\nDo I need to notify Clever that my user’s email addresses will be changing?\n\n * No. You only need to notify Clever if your user’s sis_ids (teacher_id, student_id, staff_id, etc.) will also be changing.\n\nWhy did my sync go on hold when I updated email addresses?\n\n * Sync holds are to prevent Clever Admins from making unintended changes to their data when large data changes occur. Review the\n   changes on your Last Attempted Sync page and if the changes are as expected you can approve the hold.\n\nWhat steps should I take to ensure minimal disruption to students and teachers?\n\n * Review the Important considerations when updating user emails section above for guidance on steps you can take to prevent\n   disruptions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. The Process\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen you sync your data to Clever, you are required to provide an SIS ID for each user type, section, and school as follows:\n\nData TypeSIS ID FieldSchoolSchool_idStudentStudent_idTeacherTeacher_idSectionSection_idStaffStaff_id (if your schools sync\nstaff)ContactsContact_sis_id (if your schools sync contacts)\n\n \n\nThese identifiers are what Clever uses to create the Clever ID, so if the SIS ID changes, the Clever ID will change. The Clever ID\nis what creates the user and school accounts in Clever and in most connected applications. For this reason, Clever does not\nrecommend changing SIS IDs, especially during a school year. We recommend all SIS ID changes be made in the summer between\nacademic years.\n \n\nIf an SIS ID change is being requested by an application partner:\n\nClever Support can update the data available to the application without affecting the core data in Clever or the data available to\nother applications. Please submit a support case with the following information:\n\n    •  The name of the application (Example: NWEA)\n    •  The record type (Example: Students)\n    •  The name of the field to be used as SIS ID (Example: State_id)\n\n \n\nHere’s an outline with an accompanying flowchart of how changing an SIS ID can cause the loss of historic data.\n\n 1. Student, Jamie Greene, has an account in Clever with the student_id of 7301.\n 2. Clever created the Clever ID of 641cbb82f81de671203cfc66 for Jamie’s account based on the SIS ID.\n 3. The student is shared with several applications via Clever and has accounts in each of those apps based on that Clever ID.\n 4. At some point, the school changes Jamie’s student_id to C732001 and syncs the new id to Clever so student_id 7301 is no longer\n    syncing.\n 5. Clever now sees this as a new student and deletes Jamie’s account associated with student_id 7301 since this ID is no longer\n    syncing to Clever.\n 6. Clever creates a new account based on C732001 with a new Clever ID of 529ava3902efa349206cfs01.\n 7. Jamie’s connected applications are no longer receiving Jamie’s original Clever ID because it no longer exists.\n 8. The applications create a new account based on Jamie’s new Clever ID and delete or archive the previous account based on\n    Clever ID 641cbb82f81de671203cfc66. This results in a loss of historical data and any progress since it is a completely new\n    account.\n\nHow does Clever help schools preserve data?\n\nSo how do we preserve the Clever IDs if you need to change your sync and/or SIS IDs? By running our matchmaker tool! Our\nmatchmaker tool matches up the existing SIS IDs that are in Clever with the new SIS IDs that your schools are syncing. This can\nsometimes be a slow process, potentially adding several days to a week to the conversion if we run into duplicate entries or other\nissues. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nIMPORTANT: Reusing SIS IDs \nClever treats SIS IDs as unique identifiers and uses them to generate Clever IDs. As such, to avoid data issues in Clever and\nconnected applications, do not re-use SIS IDs within 300 days of when an ID was last used.\n\n\nIf a change to the SIS ID is required, the following process will be followed. \n\n 1. Contact Clever Support \n    Submit a new support case at support.clever.com and let us know the record type that needs to be updated and the name of the\n    field that should be used as the SIS ID in Clever. \n    \n    \n    Please note: Clever cannot migrate section_ids during the school year. All changes to section_id must happen between academic\n    years\n    \n     \n 2. Migrate data\n    We will enable protection settings for your account to ensure your teacher and students are minimally affected by the changes\n    in data. During this time period, all syncing of data between the district, Clever, and connected applications will be paused.\n    However, users will still be able to access Clever and their applications.\n    \n    Once the safety settings are applied, we ensure the necessary data from your SIS is syncing to Clever. If the data looks good,\n    we will complete a matching process to preserve historical data where possible.\n    \n    ⚠️ Please allow up to two-three weeks for the matching process to be completed.\n    \n    During this time, your account may appear with a sync status of \"On Hold\" or \"System Maintenance In Progress\". This is normal\n    and will be resolved once Clever Support has finished the migration process. \n    \n 3. Confirm data changes, sync with apps\n    The final step of the process is for our team to review the changes with you, and release your district’s sync hold. Once the\n    updated data is live in Clever, please allow up to 48 hrs for the updated data to be reflected in your connected applications.\n    Application partners manage pulling data from Clever and processing it into their system. If you have any questions about the\n    effect of data changes in an application, please reach out to the application's support team. They will be happy to assist!\n\n\nReady to get started or have a question? Contact our Support Team. \n\n\ntags: sis conversions"

FAQ\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSome applications allow you to map resources to specific courses, classes, or users. This can sometimes require district\nadministrators to work with each application directly to create those mappings. To address this pain-point, we’ve created a\nfeature that helps you manage content mapping directly from your Clever dashboard!\n\n\nOnce you have successfully mapped your resources, applications will be able to automatically assign the correct content to your\nstudents and teachers. Please ensure that the application is aware that you will be setting this up before you get started!\n \n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo use content mapping, navigate to the “Content assignment” tab on the application page in the Clever dashboard and click “Get\nstarted”.\n \n\nPlease note: If you do not see this tab on the application page, the application does not support content mapping through Clever.\nAlways check with an application before mapping content to avoid any issues or miscommunication.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUPLOADING YOUR RESOURCE FILE\n\nIn order to use this tool, you will need to create a resources.csv file that contains information pertinent to the resources you\nintend to map.\n\n File Name: resources.csv\n \n\nField\n\nRequired\n\nFormat\n\nDescription\n\nresource_idYStringThe unique identifier of the resource as assigned by the application.titleYStringThe name of the resource\n\n \n\nPlease note: The resource_id and title must match with values that the application recognizes. If you are unsure of what to use as\nthe resource_id and title, you will need to reach out to the application you are working with.\n\n \n\nWhen you are ready, you can upload your file in Step 1 of the wizard.\n \n\n\n \n\n  Download    Example resources.csv file\n\n\n\nASSIGNING YOUR RESOURCES\n\nOnce you have uploaded your resources.csv file, you are ready to start assigning those resources to your courses!\n\n\nStep 2 of the content mapping wizard allows you to select courses that will be using each resource.\n\n\nTo add a course to a resource, click the button near the right side of the page. You can then enter a course name or course number\nto search for the courses you would like to map. Sections can only be mapped if they are associated with a course name or number.\nPlease be sure to associate all of your sections with a course!\n\n\nResources can be mapped to a course across all schools or to a course at a specific school. Furthermore, courses at different\nschools can be mapped to the same resource.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\nYou can click on the blue link at the end of a mapping rule to see which school it is for.\n \n\n\nFINISHING UP\n\nIn Step 3 of the wizard, you will be able to review the changes you have made. You can always go back and edit your mappings by\nnavigating to the bottom of the page and selecting \"Edit assignment rules\".\n\n\nOtherwise, you can click \"Finish\" and you're all set! The application will now be able to access your content mapping information\nand assign its resources to the intended users.\n \n\n\n\nIf your mapping is successful, you will see the following message:\n \n\n\n \n\nPlease note: After these settings are applied, the application will still need to sync with your account in order for you to see\nthose changes. If you do not see any changes, you will need to reach out to the application to have them sync with your account. \n\n✨ Additionally, please ensure you have set sharing rules for the application. If an application requires content mapping, both\nsharing rules and content assignments must be configured.  \n\n\n\nEDITING YOUR ASSIGNMENTS\n\nTo review and edit your content assignments, you can navigate back to the Content assignment tab. You will see a summary of your\ncurrent resources assigned. You will also be able to edit your existing rules. Select \"Edit assignment rules\" and you will be\ntaken back to Step 2 of the wizard where you can make changes as needed.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhere can I find resource IDs? \n \n\nResource IDs are created by the application. If you are unsure of what to use as the resource ID, be sure to reach out to the\napplication you are working with.\n \n\nWhat if I do not see the \"Content assignment\" tab?\n \n\nIf you do not see the \"Content assignment\" tab, that means the application does not have this feature available through Clever.\nYou will need to reach out to the application to discuss your options for assigning resources.\n \n\nWhy can't I see the course I would like to assign resources to?\n \n\nIf you are unable to find the course you are trying to assign a resource to, please be sure that the course is included in the\napplication's sharing permissions. For more on sharing permissions, please refer to the following article: Sharing Permissions:\nOverview\n\nWhat do I do if I upload an incorrect resources.csv file?\n \n\nYou can always re-upload a new file! New files will always overwrite the previously uploaded files.\n \n\nDo I have to assign my content this way?\n \n\nThis is up to each application and how they choose to map content in their integration. If you have questions about other content\nmapping methods, you will need to reach out to the application.\n\n \n\n \n\nIf you have any additional questions please feel free to open a support request and our team will be glad to help further!"

Custom data reports\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCustom data allows Clever Admins to create rostering data, including fields and records, directly from the Clever Dashboard that\ndoes not exist in the district's student information system (SIS) or aren't being synced to Clever. Common uses of custom data\ninclude:  \n\n * Adding summer school information\n * Organizing unique groups of students into sections (e.g., afterschool programs)\n * Adding non-teaching staff members who are not in the district's SIS\n * Maintaining historical data that was deleted from the SIS (such as if a section is deleted when a teacher leaves midyear, but\n   you want to preserve historical app data for that section. You can build a custom section in Clever using the original SIS\n   section data so app data is preserved).\n\n \n\nIMPORTANT \nPlease note that custom data can't be used until you start running a sync with your Student Information System (SIS). In addition,\nif Clever has not synced with your SIS in more than 6 months, you won't be able to add new custom data to Clever. \n\nAlso, Custom data will run during a sync pause (such as during summer school) but not a sync hold (when your sync has stopped due\nto unexpected changes to data).\n\n\n \n\nClever Admins can upload custom fields for any data type to track data not currently being synced by the district's SIS (e.g., IEP\nstatus, Dietary Requirements, Extracurricular Activities, etc.). The types of records that can be created using custom data can\neither be associated with or include:\n\n * Students\n * Teachers\n * Staff\n * Sections & Enrollments\n * Student Contacts\n * Custom fields\n\nCustom data will not overwrite any rostering data being synced to Clever by your district's SIS, nor can it be overwritten by your\nSIS-synced data. Custom data is also indistinguishable from your synced SIS data to most Clever-integrated applications. \n\n  Clever Tip: When creating custom records, we recommend using the unique SIS identifier known as the SIS ID (i.e., teacher_id,\nstudent_id, contact_id, section_id, or staff_id, respectively) if one exists for each record in your SIS. This way, if, at some\npoint, your district's SIS begins sending those same records in the standard SIS data sync, the SIS record will take precedence\nover the custom data record. Failure to match SIS IDs will result in duplicate records in Clever. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nADDING CUSTOM DATA\n\nClever supports creating custom records in Clever for the following record types:\n\n * Students\n * Teachers\n * Staff\n * Sections & Enrollments\n\nClever does not support creating custom schools. Any additional schools that need to be added to Clever will need to be synced to\nClever from your student information system. Therefore, districts must sync summer school locations via the standard SIS sync\nbefore a district's sync is paused over the summer. Please visit For District Admins: Pausing the sync with your SIS for more\nabout sync pauses.\n\nClever admins can create custom data records individually or in bulk via a CSV upload. Bulk uploads are available to all districts\nvia the Clever Dashboard > Custom data page . Please note that custom data, whether created in bulk or individually, will not\noverwrite any data that has previously synced from a district's student information system (SIS).\n\nTo download CSV file templates for uploading custom data, please click here: Download \n\nTo add individual or bulk custom data, select the Add custom data option at the top right of the Custom Data page. You can add an\nindividual record by clicking on the corresponding selection. To upload in bulk, select Upload records or Upload fields depending\non what data you are attempting to upload. \n\n\n\nPlease note: Please allow 10-15 minutes for custom data to process. Though Clever will not send an email notification that the\ndata has been processed, the results will be viewable on the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard.  \n\n\nFor additional instructions on managing custom data for specific record types, please also visit these related articles: \n\n * Custom Data: Students\n * Custom Data: Teachers\n * Custom Data: Staff\n * Custom Data: Sections\n\nFor custom data records, a Custom label will display on the record's Clever profile page (shown below).\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBROWSING CUSTOM DATA\n\nFrom the Clever Dashboard > Custom data page , districts can select the appropriate custom data tab (i.e., Students, Teachers,\nSections, or Staff) to view any custom data for that respective data type. In addition, records can be edited or deleted by using\nthe icons to the far right of the record name under the Actions column.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you notice that some of the custom data names aren’t clickable, this is most likely an indication that the data is also synced\nfrom your SIS with the same SIS ID.\n\n\n\nFor example, staff member Jen Cutler has a custom staff account with the SIS ID of 32401969, but they also have a staff account\nbeing synced from the SIS with the same SIS ID. This will cause the custom data to be unclickable.\n\n \n\n\n\nIn this screenshot, the custom staff account for Jen Cutler is unclickable.\n\n\nOf note, in the case of staff, even if the SIS ID is different but the email is the same, it will cause the custom staff account\nto be unclickable.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREMOVING CUSTOM DATA\n\n\nREMOVING INDIVIDUAL RECORDS\n\n * To remove an individual custom data record, please navigate to the Clever Dashboard > Custom data  page.\n * Select the corresponding tab for the record type you would like to remove.\n * Locate the record, and under Actions column, click  to delete the record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREMOVING RECORDS IN BULK\n\nPlease note:\n•  To only remove some records via the bulk upload, simply upload a file using one of the formats listed above. Please be sure to\ninclude all records in the file that you do not want to be deleted. As long as the record is present in the file, it will not be\ndeleted from Clever. If a record is missing from the file, it will be deleted.\n•  Uploading blank files over custom data only deletes bulk uploaded custom data and not manually created custom data. Manually\ncreated custom data will need to be deleted manually by clicking on the trash can under the Actions column in the Custom Records. \n\n\n \n\nStudents\n\n * To remove all bulk custom students at once, please upload a blank students.csv file to the Clever Dashboard > Custom data \n   > Upload records option. However, please note that the file must contain column headers. Please feel free to use the sample\n   students.csv file contained in this sample file set to remove students in bulk: Download \n\n\nTeachers\n\n * To remove all bulk custom teachers at once, please upload a blank teachers.csv file to the Clever Dashboard > Custom\n   data page > Upload records option. However, please note that the file must contain column headers. Please feel free to use the\n   teachers.csv file contained in this sample file set to remove teachers in bulk: Download \n\n\nStaff\n\n * Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Custom data page.\n * In the top-right corner, select Delete all staff.\n * Select Confirm.\n\n\nSections\n\n * To remove all bulk custom sections at once, please upload a blank sections.csv file to the Clever Dashboard > Custom data\n   page > Upload records.

Editing custom sections\n5. Deleting custom sections\n6. Sharing custom sections with apps\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCustom sections are a great way to create rostering data within Clever that does not exist in your district's student information\nsystem (SIS). This can be helpful in cases such as summer school, intervention groups, after-school programs, and more! \n\nCustom sections will not overwrite any sections being synced to Clever by a district's SIS, nor can they be overwritten by\nsections synced by the SIS. Custom sections are also indistinguishable from synced SIS sections in most Clever-integrated\napplications.\n \n\n  Only Clever Admins or School Tech Leads can create custom sections in Clever. For more details about Clever roles, please\nvisit: Clever Roles: Overview of Roles & Permissions\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCREATING INDIVIDUAL CUSTOM SECTIONS\n\nThere are two ways to create custom sections in Clever. The first method is creating individual sections from the Clever\nDashboard > Support Tools > Custom data page.\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: ADD SECTION INFO\n\n * Navigate to Support Tools > Custom data. \n * Click Add custom data > Sections.\n\n\n\n * Begin by entering a section name and the associated school location.\n   * We recommend being as descriptive as possible with section names (e.g., course_name - teacher_last_name - period).\n * Enter the class information (i.e., grade, subject, and period).\n\n\n\n * If desired, enter the optional term and course information. These fields may be helpful with identifying the section in Clever\n   and connected applications.\n\n\n\n * Enter an optional section expiration date if you want the section to be automatically deleted on the selected date.\n * Once all required fields are populated, click Next to proceed. \n\n \n\n\nSTEP 2: ADD TEACHERS\n\n * Click the primary teacher who should be associated with the section. Clever allows up to nine co-teachers for each custom\n   section.  \n   * Please note: If a teacher is not yet in Clever or in your SIS, please see this article for instructions on creating a custom\n     teacher in Clever: Custom Data: Teachers\n\n \n\nClever Tip: To select teachers from a school location other than the one where the section is located, click the white search box\nto the right to bring up a list of schools. Select additional school location(s) to bring up a list of teachers from selected\nschool(s). \n\n\n        \n\n * Click Next to proceed.\n\n \n\nIMPORTANT Note that not all applications support co-teachers. We recommend checking with the application’s support team to confirm\nif co-teachers are a supported feature.\n\n \n\n\nSTEP 3: SELECT PRIMARY TEACHER\n\n * Next, indicate which of the teachers will be the primary teacher for the section. If an application does not support\n   co-teachers, the primary teacher will be the one associated with the custom section in applications.\n * Click Next to proceed.\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: ADD STUDENTS\n\n * Select which students should be enrolled in the section.  \n   * Please note: Clever can support up to 10,000 students enrolled in a single section. However, Clever can only support up to\n     100 students enrolled in a single section for Teacher Pages to function correctly. \n\nClever Tip: To select students from a school location other than where the section is located, click the white search box to the\nright to select students from other schools. You can further filter the list of students by selecting only certain grade levels.\nPlease visit Custom Data: Students if the student is not yet in Clever or your SIS.\n\n\n\n\n * Click Next to proceed.\n\n\n\nSTEP 5: PREVIEW\n\n * Review the custom section to ensure the details look correct before clicking Create Section.\n\nPlease note: Please allow 10-15 minutes for custom data to process. Though Clever will not send an email notification that the\ndata has been processed, the results will be viewable on the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard.  \n\n\n\nSTEP 6: SHARE WITH APPLICATIONS\n\n * Once the custom section is available in Clever, you can share it with connected applications. Please see this article for\n   details.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCREATING MULTIPLE CUSTOM SECTIONS VIA UPLOAD\n\nClever Admins can also create custom sections in bulk by uploading two CSV files (sections.csv and enrollments.csv) to Clever. The\ncustom sections file will create the section, while the enrollments file will associate students to that section. \n \n\nPlease note: Bulk uploading custom sections will not impact custom sections that were created manually from the Custom\ndata page.  \n\n \n\n\nSTEP 1: CREATE YOUR SECTIONS.CSV AND ENROLLMENTS.CSV\n\n * Download the CSV file templates for uploading custom data by clicking Download, and then use the instructions below to modify\n   the sections.csv and enrollments.csv.\n * Please ensure the files are named sections.csv and enrollments.csv before uploading them, or Clever will not process them\n   successfully.\n\n \n\n\nSECTIONS.CSV\n\nColumn HeaderNotes\n\nSchool_id\n\nMust match the school_id (i.e., SIS ID) for a school that exists in Clever\n\nSection_id\n\nMust be a unique ID that is not associated with other sectionsNameUnique name for the section (e.g., Algebra 101 - Jones - Period\n1A)\n\nTeacher_id\n\nMust match a teacher_ID (i.e., teacher SIS ID) for a teacher that exists in CleverCourse_name(e.g., Algebra, Geometry, English,\nCreative Writing, etc.)SubjectSubjects should adhere to Clever's specificationsTerm_nameIf creating custom sections for summer,\ninclude \"Summer\" in this field for easier data sharing\n\n  \n\n The fields listed above are required, but you can also include additional optional fields listed in Clever's SFTP\nspecification for the sections.csv. Please note that extension fields are not supported in the custom sections.csv. For\ninformation on how to add extension data to custom sections, please see our article For Clever Admins: Syncing custom (i.e.\nextension) fields to Clever.\n\n \n\n\nENROLLMENTS.CSV\n\nColumn Header\n\nNote\n\nSchool_id\n\nMust match the school_id (i.e., SIS ID) for a school that exists in Clever\n\nSection_id\n\nMust match the section_id in the sections.csv file\n\nStudent_id\n\nMust match an existing student_id (i.e., SIS ID) for a student in Clever\n\n \n \n\n\nUPLOADING THE SECTIONS.CSV AND ENROLLMENTS.CSV \n\nThere are two ways for districts to upload sections.csv and enrollments.csv files to Clever.\n \n\nOPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): MANUAL UPLOAD\n\n * Navigate to the Clever Dashboard > Custom Data page.\n * Click Add custom data at the top right, and then choose Upload records.\n\n\n\n \n\nOPTION 2: UPLOADING THE FILES TO YOUR DISTRICT'S SFTP FOLDER\n\nThe second option for uploading the sections.csv and enrollments.csv is to access your district's Clever SFTP folder and manually\nupload the files. \n\nPlease note: This option is only available to districts that are using the SFTP sync type. This method also requires downloading\nan FTP client to your device. Visit this article for additional details.\n\n\nTo manually upload files to your district's SFTP folder, please:\n\n * Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings page to locate your district's SFTP UPLOAD URL and corresponding\n   credentials. \n\n \n * Log in to your Clever SFTP box, and create a new subfolder named 'customsections'.\n   * For instructions on accessing your district's SFTP folder, please visit: SFTP Syncs: Uploading data to Clever\n * Upload the sections.csv and enrollments.csv to the 'customsections' subfolder            \n * Once the files finish processing (within 15-20 minutes), you will be able to see the new custom sections from your Clever\n   Dashboard > Support Tools > Custom data page.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nEDITING CUSTOM SECTIONS\n\n * To edit a custom section, navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Support Tools > Custom data page.\n * From the Sections tab, click the pencil icon under the Actions column to the right of the section name.\n * This will open a custom sections wizard which allows you to make any needed adjustments.\n\n       \n\nClever Tip: Clever Admins can also edit sections by searching for them using the Clever search bar to locate the section and then\nclicking the Edit section option.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDELETING CUSTOM SECTIONS\n\n * To delete a custom section, navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Support Tools > Custom data page.\n * From the Sections tab, click the trash icon under the Actions column to the right of the section name.\n\n\n\n * To delete All custom sections in bulk, you can upload blank sections.csv and enrollments.csv files, including the column\n   headers, to your custom data page or your district's SFTP folder, if applicable. \n\nPlease note: Uploading blank files over custom data only deletes bulk uploaded custom data and not manually created custom data.\nManually created custom data will need to be deleted manually by clicking on the trash can under the Actions column in the Custom\nRecords.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSHARING CUSTOM SECTIONS WITH APPS\n\nCustom sections are shared with applications in the same way that sections synced from your district's SIS are shared. Once a\ncustom section is available (within 15-20 minutes of creating it), we recommend reviewing any application sharing permissions to\nensure the section is shared as needed. For more information on sharing permissions, see this article.\n\nIf you have any questions about custom sections, please contact Clever support! We are happy to help!\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * Custom Data: Overview (i.e., sections, students, contacts, teachers, staff & fields)\n * Custom Data: Students\n * Custom Data: Teachers"

However, if a staff member needs co-teacher access to sections from a\nteacher's perspective, Clever Admins can create a custom teacher record for them to associate them with sections. Please visit\nthis article for more: For District Admins: Co-teacher\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCREATING CUSTOM STAFF IN CLEVER\n\nCustom staff can be created individually directly within Clever, or uploaded as a csv in bulk.\n\nCustom staff accounts are independent of a district's student information system (SIS) sync. So, for example, if a district's SIS\nis syncing staff to Clever, or they are being uploaded manually per this article, this staff data will not overwrite custom staff\nadded directly via the Clever Dashboard > Support tools > Custom data page. \n\n\n\nADDING CUSTOM STAFF INDIVIDUALLY VIA CLEVER\n\nTo add a custom staff member individually in Clever, please:\n\n * Navigate to the Clever Dashboard.\n * Select Support tools > Custom data .\n * Select Add custom data.\n * Select Staff.\n\n           \n\nPlease fill out the form, which begins by associating the staff member with their school(s).\n\n * For all schools, click the switch icon under the Schools section.\n * For one school, begin typing the name in the search box to select it.\n * For multiple schools, type and select each school from the search bar. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nClever Role\n\n * For an overview of the Portal Access Only  vs. School Tech Lead roles, please see our Clever article visit: For Staff: School\n   Tech Lead vs. Portal Only Permission\n\nUsername & Password\n\n * These fields are only required if:\n   * Your district uses Clever Passwords, and the district username or password is needed for users to log in to Clever.\n   * An application partner requires a username or password to be populated within their integrated application(s).\n\nExpiration Date \n\n * Enter an optional Expiration date if you want the record to be automatically deleted on the selected date.\n\nNotifying custom staff of their new account via email \n\n * If you would like the user to be notified via email that their account has been created, check the optional Also notify custom\n   staff of their new account via email box. The notification email can also be sent after their custom staff record has been\n   saved using the envelope icon under Actions.\n\n               \n \n\n \n\n\nBULK UPLOADING CUSTOM STAFF TO CLEVER\n\nTo bulk add multiple custom staff, please:\n\n * Prepare your Staff.csv file.

Custom teachers can be added to existing sections using the\nAdd co-teacher feature in Clever or can be added to custom sections. Custom teachers can only be added as the primary teacher\nto custom sections and as co-teachers to SIS-synced sections.\n\n \n\nPlease note: Please allow up to 24 hours for your custom teachers to sync with connected applications. If you are not seeing your\ndistrict's custom teacher accounts appear in applications they are shared with, you can reach out to the application's support\nteam directly to confirm whether they support co-teachers on their platform. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMANUALLY CREATING A CUSTOM TEACHER\n\nIf you'd like to add a teacher to Clever that is not being synced from your district's student information system (SIS), you can\ncreate them as a custom teacher directly from your Clever Dashboard using one of the following methods:\n\n\n1) FROM A SECTION'S PROFILE PAGE:\n\n * Navigate to a section's profile page by searching for the section using the search bar at the top of the Clever Dashboard.\n * Under the Details tab of your section, select Add co-teacher from the right side of the page.\n * Select Create a teacher.\n * Then, enter basic demographic information about the user in the subsequent pop-up box to create their custom teacher account.\n\n\n2) FROM THE CUSTOM DATA PAGE.\n\n * Navigate to Support Tools > Custom data > Add custom data > Teachers.\n * Enter basic demographic information about the user in the subsequent pop-up box to create their custom teacher account.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBULK UPLOADING CUSTOM TEACHERS VIA A CSV UPLOAD\n\n\nFORMATTING THE FILE\n\nThe file must be named teachers.csv and saved in the CSV (Comma Separated Value) file format. The minimum header requirements are\nthe following:\n\n * school_id\n * teacher_id\n * last_name\n * first_name\n * teacher_email\n\nPlease see our spec section 3.3 for more detailed information on formatting the file, the field values that are accepted, and\ninformation about additional headers. Sample files can be downloaded here.\n\n\nUPLOADING THE FILE\n\nTo use the web upload option:\n\n 1. From the left-hand navigation, click Support Tools > Custom data.\n 2. Select Add custom data and then Upload Records.\n 3. Select teachers.csv and then choose the file from your device.\n 4. Once the upload icon displays a green checkmark , select Upload.\n\nClever will automatically trigger a sync within the next five minutes to begin processing the new data, taking about 15-20 minutes\nto complete. The newly uploaded data will not be fully available in Clever until then.\n \n\n\nSFTP UPLOAD\n\nIf you prefer to upload the custom teachers directly to your district's Clever SFTP folder:\n\n 1. Using a free FTP Client, log in to your Clever SFTP directory using the credentials found in your Clever Dashboard > Sync >\n    Settings page.\n 2. Create a new folder appended to your standard directory called: customteachers\n 3. Upload the teachers.csv file to the new customteachers directory.\n\nClever will automatically trigger a sync within the next five minutes to begin processing the new data, taking about 15-20 minutes\nto complete. The newly uploaded data will not be fully available in Clever until then.\n\n \n\nPlease note: Please allow 10-15 minutes for custom data to process. Though Clever will not send an email notification that the\ndata has been processed, the results will be viewable on the Sync page in the Clever Dashboard.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVIEWING CUSTOM TEACHERS\n\nClever admins can view up to 200 successfully created custom teachers through the Clever Dashboard > Custom data page. If your\ndistrict has more than 200 custom teachers, all records can be viewed from the Data Browser or by using the search bar at the top\nof the Clever Dashboard to locate individual custom teacher records.\n\nPlease note: If the custom teacher(s) will be joining the district's account in the Fall through the normal SIS sync, the\nTeacher_id used for the custom account should match their Teacher_id in the SIS.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDELETING CUSTOM TEACHERS\n\nTo remove all custom teachers at once, please upload a blank teachers.csv file to the Clever Dashboard > Custom data page > Upload\nRecords option. However, please note that the file must contain column headers. Please feel free to use the teachers.csv file\ncontained in this sample file set to remove teachers in bulk: Download\n\nTo remove only some teacher records via the bulk upload, simply upload a file using one of the formats listed above. Please be\nsure to include all records in the file that you do not want to be deleted. As long as the record is present in the file, it will\nnot be deleted from Clever. If a record is missing from the file, it will be deleted.\n\nTo remove an individual custom data record, please navigate to the Clever Dashboard > Custom data page.\n\n * Select the corresponding tab for the record type you would like to remove.\n * Locate the record, and under the Actions column, click the icon to delete the record.\n\nPlease note: Manually deleting teachers individually using the trash icon will delete the user entirely from Clever. However, if\nthe teacher was bulk uploaded to the Clever Dashboard > Custom data page, they would still be present in the custom teachers.csv\nfile even after the trash icon is selected. If the user is still present in the following uploaded custom teachers.csv file with\nthe same teacher_id (i.e., teacher SIS ID), the user will be re-added to Clever.  \n\nConversely, uploading blank files over custom data only deletes bulk uploaded custom data and not manually created custom data.\nManually created custom data will need to be deleted manually by clicking on the trash can under the Actions column in the Custom\nRecords.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN AS A CUSTOM TEACHER\n\nCustom teachers will log in to Clever the same way teachers syncing from your SIS log in. Just make sure to add any details (e.g.,\nemail, teacher_id, etc.) required by your selected login method. To check to see what your login method is, navigate in your\nClever Dashboard to SSO & Portal > SSO Settings > Login method.\n\n \n\nPlease note: If you are utilizing the teacher_number field for login credentials, Clever does not currently support syncing a\nunique teacher_number for custom teachers. The teacher_id (sis_id) will be used to populate the teacher_number field.\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated Articles: \n\n * Custom Data: Overview (i.e., sections, students, contacts, teachers, staff & fields)\n * Custom Data: Students\n * Custom Data: Teachers\n * Custom Data: Staff\n * Custom Data: Sections"

They can only be added to custom\nsections. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nINDIVIDUALLY CREATE CUSTOM STUDENTS\n\nTo create an individual custom student, navigate to the Custom Data page. Click Add custom data > Students and a “Create student”\nform will appear. Once created, custom student accounts can be treated like an SIS-synced student account.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBULK CREATE CUSTOM STUDENTS\n\n\nHOW DO I FORMAT THE FILE?\n\nThe file will need to be titled \"students\" and saved as a CSV file type. The minimum header requirements are the following:\n\n * school_id\n * student_id\n * last_name\n * first_name\n\nPlease see our spec section 3.2 for more detailed information on the file format, what values are accepted, and information about\nadditional headers. A sample file can be downloaded here: Download\n\nPlease note: Contacts for custom students cannot be uploaded in the custom students.csv file. They need to be uploaded in a\nseparate custom contacts.csv file. Instructions on how to do so can be found here.\n\n\n\nWEB UPLOAD\n\nIf you would like to use the web upload option:\n\n 1. From the left-hand navigation, click Support tools > Custom data\n 2. From the top-right, click Add custom data and select Upload records\n    \n\nOnce uploaded, you will see the following status message:\n\n \n\n \n\n\nSFTP UPLOAD\n\nSFTP Upload is only available to districts that use SFTP as their primary sync method.

Check out our Onboarding - Getting your schools’ data into\nClever course, available in Clever Academy!\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhether you’re exporting data for an SFTP sync directly from your Student Information System (SIS), or building your own CSV files\nto sync data to Clever, there are a number of commonly asked questions our team receives as shown below:\n\n\nGENERAL SFTP SYNC QUESTIONS\n\n * What CSV files are required to sync with Clever?\n * How do my data files work together?\n * What if I’m not sure how to export data from my SIS?\n * Is there a way to manually sync data to Clever, or add users one at a time?\n * Can your team review my data files before I upload them?\n * Can I upload the files one at a time so you can make sure I'm on the right track before uploading all of them?\n * How do I know if my data upload went through?\n\n\nFILE REQUIREMENTS AND FORMATTING QUESTIONS\n\n * Do I need to include a schools.csv file if we’re a single school?\n * Do I need to include a sections.csv file?\n * What's the difference between teacher_id and teacher_number (or school_id and school_number, or student_id and student_number)?\n * How do I know if additional fields are required for a particular application?\n\n\nUPDATING OR EDITING DATA\n\n * Can I manually trigger a sync?\n * How do I archive classes in Clever?\n * How do I remove data from Clever?\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\n * Why didn't my data update after pushing a sync?\n * Why is grade level showing as \"Other\" in Clever?\n * Do you have content to help me troubleshoot the data errors on my last attempted sync page?\n\n\nPlease note: This article is specifically about SFTP syncs. If you use a Clever-managed auto-sync, please click here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nWhat CSV files are required to sync with Clever?\n\n * The Clever SFTP Specifications outline the five required CSV files for a data sync to complete: \n   * schools.csv\n   * teachers.csv\n   * students.csv\n   * sections.csv\n   * enrollments.csv. \n\nThe staff.csv is an optional additional file for adding non-teaching staff to Clever. Learn more in this article.\n\n\n\nHow do my data files work together?\n\n * This graphic is helpful to explain how your files work together:\n\n\n\n\nIs there a way to manually sync data to Clever, or add users one at a time?\n\n * Your 5 required fields must initially be synced at the same time. These can be synced to Clever from your SIS, via an FTP\n   client, or manually uploaded to your Clever Dashboard via the Web Upload Tool found on your Sync page.\n\nAny updates or changes to users should be completed by editing and reuploading these data files. Please note that the entire file\nmust be uploaded as each file overwrites the previous.\n\nClever doesn't recommend adding or managing accounts through the Custom Data tool if you’re managing your own CSV files manually\nas this often creates confusion on the primary source of data for your district.\n\nCustom data is intended to compliment data coming from the primary CSV files, not replace it.\n\n\n\nWhat if I’m not sure how to export data from my SIS?\n \n\n * While our teams are happy to answer any questions you have regarding our Clever SFTP Specifications, file formatting, or the\n   manual data upload process to Clever, we don’t have insight into your individual SIS instance and the export processes.\n * We recommend reaching out to your SIS team directly or checking for online help center documentation if you have questions\n   about using the export tools in your SIS.\n\n\n\nCan your team review my data files before I upload them?\n \n * For security reasons, the Clever team does not recommend sending CSV files via email.\n * Additionally, our system automatically surfaces errors that our team may not manually detect! We recommend completing all five\n   required CSV files and uploading them to Clever, and then our team is happy to review the files and provide additional insight\n   into any errors that may occur.\n\n\n\nCan I upload the files one at a time so you can make sure I'm on the right track before uploading all of them?\n \n * As you add each file to Clever via the upload tab, our system automatically surfaces basic errors.\n * That said, since the five CSV files interact during the data sync process, we recommend uploading all five files to ensure they\n   properly work together.\n * Once you’ve uploaded the five files to Clever, our team is happy to review the files and provide additional insight into any\n   errors that may occur.\n\n\n\nDo I need to include a schools.csv file if we are a single school?\n \n * Yes! The schools.csv is required even if you’re a single school. This is how Clever’s sync system will know to associate your\n   teacher and students with the school.\n\n\nDo I need to include a sections.csv file?\n \n\n * Yes! The sections.csv file is how Clever syncs your classes and assigns students to their class(es).\n * Even if you only have one section/class per grade, a sections.csv is required. The section_id can be any unique value that is\n   kept consistent across the section.csv and enrollments.csv. If you’re making your own files, our team recommends keeping it\n   simple and using single numbers (section_id = 1, section_id = 2 for each section/class).\n\n\n\nHow do I know if my data upload went through?\n \n * A sync will occur any time data is successfully uploaded to Clever.\n * They generally take 15-30 minutes to complete. If you’ve uploaded new data to Clever, please give the sync at least 30 minutes\n   to complete.\n * Once 30 minutes have passed, please review your Clever Dashboard > Sync page for the status of your sync. You should also\n   receive an email to the email address in your Clever profile.\n * Click here to learn more about your sync status!\n\n\n\n \n\nWhy didn't my data update after pushing a sync?\n\n * First, make sure the sync actually processed by looking at the sync status at the top of the home page of your Clever\n   Dashboard.\n\n \n\n * After confirming that the sync went through and that the data did not update by reviewing the Sync page, the next step is to\n   check your files. \n * Head to your FTP directory to ensure you don't have duplicate files. Having duplicate files will cause Clever to continue\n   reading the first file that was uploaded while ignoring the newest one. Click here for a tutorial on accessing your remote site\n   via an FTP client, or follow the instructions below.\n\n 1. Open the FTP client (like Filezilla, which is what this example uses) and enter the directory details found on your Sync >\n    Settings page. Click Quickconnect.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2. Once connected, on the right, you will see the CSV files in your Clever SFTP directory (Remote site). Check to see if any\n    files are duplicated. In the example below, you can see the teachers.csv file has a duplicate file.\n    \n\n\n\n 3. Right-click the duplicate files and select \"delete.\"\n 4. Re-upload the correct file to replace the duplicates.\n 5. Clever will begin processing the updated file approximately five minutes after it has been uploaded to your FTP box. Please\n    note that it may take 30 minutes for the sync to fully complete\n\n\nWhat's the difference between teacher_id and teacher_number (or school_id and school_number, or student_id and student_number)?\n \n * All of the user_id fields (school_id, teacher_id, student_id) are required fields for syncing data to Clever as this ID is the\n   basis for the creation of a Clever ID, and the source of truth for which historical data is tied to in Clever. Our Clever SFTP\n   Specifications requires this field be unique to each user in the district.\n\n * While school_number is required, any additional user_number fields (teacher_number, student_number) are optional in Clever. \n * Many schools will re-use their chosen user_id for this field, or populate it with another unique number available in their SIS\n   such as a user’s state ID\n * Should you choose to populate the user_number field, please note that this field should also be unique to each user in the\n   district.\n\n\n\nHow do I know if additional fields are required for a particular application?\n \n * If you think an application partner may require specific data fields, we recommend reaching out to the application partner\n   directly to confirm if they have required fields in addition to the fields required to sync data to Clever.\n\n * Once you’ve added the application, your district/school-specific Clever SFTP Specifications can be found on your Clever\n   Dashboard > Sync > Settings page. After adding applications, this document will show any required fields for a particular\n   application that the Clever team is aware of.\n * For the most accurate data field requirements, we also recommend reaching out directly to the application partner!\n\n\n\nCan I manually trigger a sync?\n * Yes! To trigger a sync, you will need to send a new set of files to Clever, and Clever will automatically trigger a sync.\n   Uploading too many times in a short period of time may trigger a sync upload error.\n\nHow do I archive classes in Clever?\n\n * There is not a way to archive sections/classes within Clever at this time. However, sections can be assigned term data to show\n   applications when the section is active or not. If you wish to remove old sections in Clever, you will need to remove the\n   sections from your SIS sync. For SFTP sync, this would mean removing the sections from the sections.csv file.\n\nHow do I remove data in Clever?\n\n * To remove data in Clever, you will need to remove the data from the CSV files being sent to Clever for your SIS sync. Once\n   Clever is no longer receiving that data, it will be removed. You can see any data that has been removed from the most recent\n   sync on the Sync page.\n\nWhy is grade level showing as \"Other\" in Clever?\n\n * If grade level data is showing as \"Other\" in Clever, this means that the data we are receiving doesn't align with the Clever\n   data requirements. Check out the accepted grade-level entries here: Data Formatting Instructions.\n\nDo you have content to help me troubleshoot the data errors on my last attempted sync page?\n\n * Yes! Check out our article Sync Reports: Error Messages. This article also links to additional articles for troubleshooting\n   which contain helpful tutorial videos!"

Uploading multiple student contacts\n7. Multi-site users (users at multiple schools)\n8. Quote Surrounded Fields\n9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\nIf your schools are brand-new to Clever, we recommend going through our onboarding courses in Clever Academy to access\nstep-by-step support on getting set up with Clever.\n\n \n\nThis article describes how to set up the data files you'll send to Clever if you choose to manually upload your school or\ndistrict's data or if you choose to set up an SFTP sync.\n\nAs a refresher, you have a few options for getting your school or district data into Clever (and therefore any other app you\nconnect to Clever):\n\n * Option 1: Manually uploading the data via the Sync > Upload page.\n * Option 2: Using an automated SFTP transfer (see here for more information).\n * Option 3: Use a managed automatic sync (see here for more information).\n\n\nIf you choose options one or two, you must properly format and upload five comma-separated value (CSV) spreadsheet files to get\nyour data into Clever.\n\nAll CSV files should follow Clever’s file formatting requirements, regardless of which applications you use. For more technical\ninformation, please refer to our SFTP Instructions, which provide highly detailed directions for setting up your CSV files. You\nmust be logged in to view the SFTP Instructions. In addition, you can check out this article for CSV formatting errors.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT’S A CSV FILE?\n\nCSV files store a line of text for each data record, where the field values for that record are separated by commas. Here’s what\ncomma-separated values look like:\n \n\n\n\nThis data can also be represented in a table format, which is what you see when opening the file in a spreadsheet application like\nExcel. Here’s the same data represented as a table:\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCREATING CSV FILES\n\nThe best way to generate the five files you’ll upload to Clever is to export data directly from your Student Information System\n(SIS) in CSV format. Typing data by hand or manipulating data once it’s exported can lead to unexpected file formatting errors,\nwhich can prevent your data from being processed in Clever.\n\n\nExcel is commonly used to view CSV files, but it often imposes formatting that skews data and results in SFTP Upload Errors. For\nerror-free viewing and saving CSV files, we recommend using an application built for CSV compatibility, such as CSVEdit, Sublime\nText, Apache OpenOffice, TextEdit, or Notepad. For more information about troubleshooting file format issues, see this help\narticle.\n\n\nThe file names for the CSV files should be the following (all lowercase letters): \n\n * schools.csv\n * students.csv\n * teachers.csv\n * sections.csv\n * enrollments.csv\n\nThe templates for these CSV files can be found here. \n\nThis graphic is helpful to explain how your files work together:\n\n\n\nIt is important that the file names are consistent in case (upper/lower case) in each upload. Uploading \"Schools.csv\" vs.\n\"schools.csv\" will result in two different files being stored in the district's SFTP box and can result in sync errors. \n\nIf you will be manually creating your CSV files, we highly encourage you to view this playlist of videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nOur SFTP Instructions include all possible fields you can upload and indicate whether each is required by Clever (bolded in the\nSFTP specifications and marked “YES” or “NO” under “Required”). The screenshot below shows some of the possible fields for\nschools.csv, where ‘School_id’ and ‘School_name’ are required, but ‘State_id’ is not required.\n\n\n\nOptional fields may be left blank, or you can leave them out of the CSV altogether. However, Clever recommends including as many\nfields as possible to take full advantage of reporting features in current applications, and to ensure compatibility with future\napp connections.\n\nDepending on which applications you connect your Clever account to, additional fields may be required beyond Clever’s minimum\nrequired fields. Check your district’s personalized SFTP instructions on your Sync Settings page to learn which fields are\nrequired by your connected applications.\n\n  Please note: ‘Nces_id’ is not an accepted field. If you need to populate NCES_id values for your schools or district please\ncontact Clever Support using the blue chat box in the bottom right corner of the Help Center.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT WILL MY FILES LOOK LIKE?\n\nSee the screenshots below for examples of how each file should look. Yellow highlighted areas represented the minimum required\nfields for each file.\n\nPlease note, the screenshots below do not show all possible fields for each file. Please refer to Clever’s SFTP Instructions to\nconfirm all accepted fields. You can also download example files from the Web Upload page.\n\n\nPlease see our note under “How should I create my 5 CSV files?” - if you view files in Excel, we recommend closing without saving\nto avoid formatting errors.\n\n \n\n\nSCHOOLS.CSV\n\n\n\n\nSTUDENTS.CSV\n\n\n\n\nTEACHERS.CSV\n\n\n\n\nSTAFF.CSV\n\n\n\n\nSECTIONS.CSV\n\n\n\n\n\nENROLLMENTS.CSV\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUPLOADING MULTIPLE STUDENT CONTACTS\n\nIf you would like to sync more than one guardian/emergency contact for each student, you can list the student record multiple\ntimes in the students.csv file. Each row must have the same student information (student_id, name, email address, etc.) but the\ncontact columns will have different information for each contact. Even though the student_id is listed multiple times, the student\nrecords will not receive a \"duplicate id error\" in the Sync Report for this particular instance. Please note - if providing\nstudent contacts, 'Contact_type' and 'Contact_name' columns are required.\n\n\nBelow is what student contacts look like in the students.csv file:\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMULTI-SITE USERS (USERS AT MULTIPLE SCHOOLS)\n\nUsers can be associated with multiple schools in Clever. Here's how that is done!\n\n\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nEach student should only be associated with one school_id in the student.csv, otherwise you will receive a \"duplicate sis_id\"\nerror. Students will be associated with multiple schools via their enrollments. If a student has enrollments in sections at\nmultiple schools, they will be associated with the respective schools. \n \n\n\nTEACHERS\n\nEach teacher should have only have one record in the teachers.csv file, otherwise you will receive a \"duplicate sis_id\" error.\nAdditional school associations will be processed from the sections.csv file. Clever will process all of the teacher's section\nassignments, giving them access to sections at multiple schools. Additionally, they will be associated with the respective\nschools. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nQUOTE SURROUNDED FIELDS\n\nIf a value for a field contains a comma or quotes, it will skew the CSV and result in one or more records not processing. To\nresolve the issue, export the CSV with quotes surrounding the fields. \n\nFor example: \n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nFord, Tom\"Ford, Tom\"Thomas \"Tom\" Ford\"Thomas \"Tom\" Ford\"Math, 2nd Period\"Math, 2nd Period\"123 Baker Street, Apt. 102\"123 Baker\nStreet, Apt. 102\"\n\n\n\nMany SISs will have the option to surround field values in quotes upon export. For example, in PowerSchool's Data Export Manager,\nit is located under Export Options:\n\n\n\n\nFor information on how to surround field values in quotes upon export, please contact your SIS directly. \n\n\nMicrosoft Excel or Google Sheets\nIf manually constructing your file in Excel or Google Sheets, they do not have an automated way to export a field surrounded with\ndouble quotes. As such, the easiest way to add quote surrounds is on a field-by-field basis.\n\nFor example, if you would like to surround Column B with double quotes, insert a blank column to the right (C), and enter the\nfollowing formula in C2: =CONCATENATE(\"\"\"\",B2,\"\"\"\")\n\nCopy cell B2 and paste it to the rest of the desired cells to apply the concatenate formula. You can then \"Hide\" Column B prior to\nexport to ensure the desired data is exported only once, surrounded in double-quotes.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)\n\n \n\nFor a complete list of all SFTP FAQs, please see this article.\n\nWhat CSV files are required to sync with Clever?\n\n * The Clever SFTP Specifications outline the five required CSV files for a data sync to complete: \n   * schools.csv\n   * teachers.csv\n   * students.csv\n   * sections.csv\n   * enrollments.csv. \n\nThe staff.csv is an optional additional file for adding non-teaching staff to Clever.\n \nDo I need to include a schools.csv file if we are a single school?\n * Yes! The schools.csv is required even if you’re a single school. This is how Clever’s sync system will know to associate your\n   teacher and students with the school.\n\nDo I need to include a sections.csv file?\n\n * Yes! The sections.csv file is how Clever syncs your classes and assigns students to their class(es).\n * Even if you only have one section/class per grade, a sections.csv is required. The section_id can be any unique value that is\n   kept consistent across the section.csv and enrollments.csv. If you’re making your own files, our team recommends keeping it\n   simple and using single numbers (section_id = 1, section_id = 2 for each section/class).\n\n\nHow do I know if my data upload went through?\n * A sync will occur any time data is successfully uploaded to Clever.\n * They generally take 15-30 minutes to complete. If you’ve uploaded new data to Clever, please give the sync at least 30 minutes\n   to complete.\n * Once 30 minutes have passed, please review your Clever Dashboard > Sync page for the status of your sync. You should also\n   receive an email to the email address in your Clever profile.\n * Click here to learn more about your sync status!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles\n\n * SFTP Syncs: SFTP Sync FAQ\n * SFTP Syncs: Uploading data to Clever\n * SFTP Syncs: Troubleshooting CSV formatting errors"

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n \n\nPlease note: If this experience looks different from what you're seeing, please check out this article as we're slowly rolling out\na new, improved version of the web upload tool for users.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe web upload tool now makes it easier to upload your schools' data to Clever by helping you match the columns in your files to\nthe columns Clever requires, such as school_id, using field mapping. A field mapping is when you assign the column headers that\nyou sync to Clever via CSV upload to a Clever field. You can associate a column header from your uploaded file to multiple\nrequired Clever fields.\n\nAs an example, you could map your school number field to both School_id and School_number in Clever. Keep in mind, that the\nreverse is not available, as you can’t associate a Clever field with multiple column headers. \n\nThis is a useful tool for districts that manage their Clever files and don’t have a way to edit the files they are uploading, for\nexample, if you are using a SIS-Managed Auto Sync and your SIS is not able to edit a file header for you. Keep reading to learn\nhow to upload your files with field mappings!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINITIAL FILE UPLOAD\n\nStep 1: Prepare the following 5 required files to upload to Clever:\n\n * schools.csv\n\n * teachers.csv\n\n * students.csv\n\n * sections.csv\n\n * enrollments.csv\n\n * staff.csv (optional)\n\n\nMake sure your files include all data that is marked as required for each file in the Clever SFTP Specifications. \n\n \n\nClever Tip: View the correct column headers for each file type in the How to format your files section of this Clever Academy\nQuick Start Guide.\n\n \n\nStep 2: Upload your files on your Sync page under the Upload tab as shown: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nStep 3: After you click Upload, you’ll check that each required file (schools, students, teachers, sections, and enrollments) has\nthe correct column headers.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe required column headers are listed first. Once you fill out the required column headers, the optional fields will appear.\nClick Next step after going through each data type. During these steps, you’ll make sure that the column headers match the\ncorresponding fields in Clever. \n\nStep 4:  Once you’ve completed each CSV file, you’ll get to Review & submit.  Here you can review your column headers and the\nClever fields. If everything looks correct, you can click Submit.  After approximately 30 minutes, your uploaded data will be\nreflected in Clever.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUPDATING YOUR DATA AFTER YOUR INITIAL SYNC\n\nAny time you need to update your data in Clever, whether you are adding a new student to Clever or adjusting a field mapping, you\nwill need to repeat the steps outlined above. Just be sure to include ALL records for each file type you upload. Clever will see\nany missing data in the files as needing to be deleted. \n\nOnce you’ve uploaded your files, you will be prompted to review your field mappings to make adjustments as needed. If your field\nmappings don’t need to be changed, you can click Submit.\n\n  Please note: Please do not change the field mappings for any sis_id values (school_id, student_id, teacher_id, section_id,\nstaff_id) after your initial data sync. Changing sis_ids may cause a loss of historical data. Please contact Clever Support if you\nneed to change sis_ids.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREVIEW EXISTING FIELD MAPPINGS\n\nYou can view your field mappings on the Settings tab at any time.\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)\n\nWhat does it mean to complete a field mapping?\n\n * A field mapping is when one field is linked to another. With the field mapping tool, you are assigning a header (field) in your\n   CSV files to a field in Clever.\n\nHow do I know which field in my CSV files should be mapped to each Clever field?\n\n * You should choose the fields that are most closely related. For example, a value of 123456 in your student CSV titled\n   student_code may be fitting for both student_id and student_number. You can map the student_code field in your students.csv to\n   both the student_id and student_number fields in Clever.\n\nDo I need to change my field mappings after my first sync?\n\n * Only if you have added new fields! You should be sure to review your existing field mappings for each new data sync to confirm\n   no changes are needed.\n\nCan I change my sis_id mappings?\n\n * Please consult Clever Support if you need to change any sis_id (school_id, student_id, teacher_id, section_id) values. Changing\n   ID field mappings may result in a loss of historical data.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * SFTP Syncs: Viewing Clever CSV files\n\n * SFTP Syncs: Troubleshooting CSV formatting errors\n\n * SFTP & Manual Upload"

You have a couple options for\ngetting your school or district data into Clever (and therefore any other app you connect to Clever):\n\n * Option 1: Manually uploading the data via the Sync > Upload page.\n * Option 2: Using an automated SFTP transfer (see here for more information).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nOPTION 1: CLEVER'S WEB UPLOAD TOOL\n\n \n\n\nOnboarding to Clever and want to learn about uploading CSV files? Check out our Onboarding - Getting your schools’ data into\nClever course, available in Clever Academy!\n\n \n\nYou can find the Web Upload tool from your Sync > Upload page. From there you can drag and drop each file, or click the cloud to\nbrowse and attach each CSV file.\n\nSelect Upload and wait until the top of the page displays Your files have been uploaded before leaving the page. \n \n\nPlease note: While not always required, it is best practice to always upload the entire set of files (schools.csv, teachers.csv,\nstudents.csv, sections.csv and enrollments.csv) every time you do an upload.  \n\n \n\nTo learn more about this process and how you can map your fields to Clever fields, please review this article.\n\n\n\nWHY IS THE WEB UPLOAD TOOL MISSING?\n\nThe Web Upload Tool is only available to districts that are SFTP. The Web Upload Tool page will redirect districts that use\nSIS-managed SFTP syncs or Clever-managed syncs to the Custom Data page:\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHow can I add staff?\n\nIf your school district uses an SIS-managed SFTP sync or a Clever-managed sync, you can upload staff on the Sync > Staff Data page\nvia the following options:\n\n * Sync with your SIS auto sync\n * Upload a staff.csv to your Clever SFTP directory\n * Active Directory sync (if staff members have Active Directory accounts)\n * Add additional staff as Custom Data on the Custom Data page\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nOPTION 2: FTP CLIENT\n\nAnother option for sending files to Clever is using the Secure File Transfer Protocol, also known as SSH File Transfer Protocol.\nThe following outlines the process for manually uploading files through an FTP client. Many districts write a script to upload\nfiles via SFTP automatically. At this time Clever does not provide support for setting up these automations.\n\n\nThere are many FTP clients available (e.g. Transmit, FileZilla or WinSCP). When you choose an FTP client, first confirm that it\nwill support SFTP, as not all clients will. SFTP is not the same as FTP over SSH, FTP over SSL, FTPS or Simple File Transfer\nProtocol. \n\n\nEach client's interface will look a little different, but each will involve similar steps. Check out this interactive tutorial, or\nfollow the instructions below which show Filezilla's interface: \n \n\n 1. Download and install an FTP client program that supports SFTP.\n 2. Log into your Clever dashboard and locate your SFTP credentials in the SFTP Settings box on the Dashboard > Sync > Settings\n    page (see below for more information).\n 3. Open the FTP client program, enter your SFTP credentials (\"host\" is the SFTP Upload URL), and click 'Quickconnect'; Note: some\n    FTP clients will require a modified URL configuration such as sftp.clever.com. Please reference their help documentation.\n    \n    \n\n 4. Once the link between your 'Local Site' and 'Remote Site' is established, you should see the files already stored in the host\n    site appear on the right side of the window.\n 5. Browse the 'Local Site' (your computer's hard drive, on the left side of the window) until you find all five of the CSV files\n    you would like to upload. Drag them from the 'Local Site' to the 'Remote Site' into the folder with your district's username.\n    In the image below, the username is wise-information-1089. (Please note: our system will only process files that adhere to our\n    naming protocol– schools.csv, teachers.csv, students.csv, enrollments.csv, sections.csv). Please be consistent with\n    capitalization to avoid duplicate files.\n    \n    \n\n 6. This may prompt a pop-up to appear, pictured below. If so, allow the program to overwrite preexisting data in the host site\n    with the incoming data. (You should only have 5 files in your 'Remote Site' at one time).\n    \n    \n\n 7. Clever will begin processing any updated files or new uploads approximately five minutes after they have been uploaded to your\n    FTP box. Please note that it may take 30 minutes for the sync to fully complete.\n\n Clever does not move or delete files after processing, so please be sure your SFTP folder settings are configured to always write\nover existing files with newly uploaded files!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOCATING YOUR SFTP CREDENTIALS\n\nYou can find these credentials on the Dashboard > Sync > Settings page. To ensure the safety of your information, we will never\nsend or request your SFTP password over email or on the phone.\n\nPlease follow the instructions below to retrieve your SFTP username and password:\n \n\n 1. Log into your Clever account at http://schools.clever.com. You'll need to use the email and password that you created when you\n    signed up for your Clever account.\n 2. From the left sidebar, click Sync.\n 3. Click on the Settings tab.\n 4. You'll see the SFTP username and password. We suggest copy/pasting the password into your FTP client to prevent any typos.\n    * Please note: \n      * Districts cannot change their SFTP usernames or passwords.\n      * Please use the information in the SFTP Settings box (not the box titled SFTP Settings - Saved Passwords Applications).\n      * For the Veracross SIS, don't include the leading \"sftp://\"\" at the beginning of the SFTP UPLOAD URL, otherwise you'll get\n        a sync error.\n\n           \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER’S SFTP HOST KEYS\n\nEvery time your district's SFTP client connects to Clever, it will check our SFTP server's Host Key to ensure your data is being\nsafely transmitted to the correct server.\n\n\nEach SFTP client handles Host Keys slightly differently. The following is documentation on some of the leading SFTP clients:\n \n\n * WinSCP\n * Filezilla\n\n\nThe following are Clever's Public SFTP Host Keys:\n\n|1|2JTJAY17moTn4gIUyBLtYzhGjVQ=|g6AJPvQiCXDxHzLkqB/gJQzfGkQ= ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBPr8wQCP3VKLB0K/8wKI2oK+ICS+VRLRk8k0CC0nwXXAHHMVCOGZyVVJT6mM/zmpygV3z6Dfn45vuCB7ohjVnU8=\n\n|1|Cmwc8pyP2jol9g2ycotT+9HqX9U=|idyXWAmWX4Hf7i0F0FclE067Hu8= ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBPr8wQCP3VKLB0K/8wKI2oK+ICS+VRLRk8k0CC0nwXXAHHMVCOGZyVVJT6mM/zmpygV3z6Dfn45vuCB7ohjVnU8=\n\n\nThe following are Clever's Public Key Fingerprints:\n\nsftp://sftp.clever.com\n\n256 76:0c:bb:e5:f7:df:97:c3:f2:77:0d:9a:2e:d7:92:18 (ECDSA)\n\n2048 f3:62:21:31:be:64:d0:a6:7d:60:73:d6:de:f9:bd:39 (RSA)\n\nsftp://credentials-sftp.clever.com\n\n2048 26:d5:98:79:6f:ed:50:95:48:f2:22:e5:12:98:93:92 (RSA)\n\n \n\n Should you have any issues formatting your CSV files, please visit this article."

Uploading a CSV file without column headers\nwill result in an error message like this: \n \n\n \n\nYou can take the following steps to fix this error:\n\n 1. When exporting data directly from your Student Information System (SIS) or through an SQL query, double check that a header\n    row is included in the export.\n 2. Headers must match Clever’s header names in the SFTP Instructions exactly.\n 3. If you’re having trouble exporting data from your SIS, please contact your SIS directly; Clever is unable to troubleshoot\n    exporting data from your SIS and SQL for SFTP Syncs.\n\n If you need help formatting your CSV files, see the following Help Center article: How do I format my CSV files?\n\n\nOnce your files include header rows according to Clever’s specified file format, upload all five files again. Your sync status\nshould change once your data is processed.    \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRECEIVED EXPORT WITH ZERO DATA\n\nClever requires all five CSV files in order to process your data upload.

Leading zeros\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen you upload a CSV that contains one or more errors, you’ll see error messages in Clever. This article runs through errors and\nhow to fix them for both automated SFTP and manual CSV uploads.\n\nWhen uploading data on the Sync > Upload page, you’ll see the errors listed shortly after uploading the CSV file(s). You can find\nClever's CSV file templates here.\n\nPlease note: If you want to download the most recent CSV files uploaded to Clever, you can do so at Clever Dashboard > Sync > Last\nAttempted Sync. Learn more here!\n\n\n \n\nWhen errors occur from an SFTP sync, you’ll see the errors listed in the Status section on the Clever Dashboard > Sync page.\n\n\n \n\nOne way to avoid some common errors is to understand how your files work together. This graphic is helpful to explain this:  \n\n\n \n\nPlease note: To avoid CSV formatting errors, we recommend exporting data from your SIS directly in CSV format, and uploading those\nfiles directly to Clever without manipulating them. Excel is commonly used to view CSV files, but it often imposes formatting that\nskews data and results in SFTP upload errors. For error-free viewing and saving of CSV files, we recommend using an application\nbuilt for CSV compatibility, such as CSVEdit, Sublime Text, Apache OpenOffice, TextEdit, or Notepad.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nERROR CODES AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM\n\nThe table below lists the errors you may see when you run into an SFTP error and how to resolve the errors.\n\nOf note, it is common for schools to see specific data errors on the Last Attempted Sync page, and these errors do not need to be\nfully resolved for the Clever sync to continue operating. These errors indicate a specific record that failed to sync to Clever,\nand as long as these errors are not directly impacting user access or applications it is typically safe to ignore these errors.\nError counts may change and resolve over time as data changes in your SIS throughout the school year.\n\n\n\n \n\nError:\n\nStep(s) to take:\n\nThe following required file is missing:\n[file]Upload the required missing file(s).\n The following required file is empty:\n[file]Ensure the file(s) in question contain the required data. The file should have a row of headers followed by at least one row\nof data. See the SFTP spec for the list of required data.\n The following required file contains no data:\n[file]Ensure the file(s) in question contain the required data. The file should have a row of headers followed by at least one row\nof data. See the SFTP spec for the list of required data.The following file is missing required headers:\n[file] [missing header]Double-check the file(s) have the missing header(s).

Trailing commas can result when columns are\ndeleted or column headers removed. When the file is uploaded to Clever, an extra trailing comma will skew subsequent rows of data,\npreventing them from being processed.\n \n\nTo identify this issue, we recommend opening the file in a text editor (like Notepad for PC, or TextEdit for Mac). You’ll see\ntrailing commas at the end of each row, like this:\n \n\n \n\nTake these steps to resolve the issue:\n \n\n 1. Open a new, blank spreadsheet in Excel.\n 2. Type in only the column headers for the data you will include in your upload.\n 3. Save the file as MS-DOS Comma Separated with a new name (e.g., “students2.csv”).\n 4. Open the old file (with the extra commas) and copy the rows below the column headers.\n 5. Paste the rows into the new file under your typed column headers.\n 6. Save your new file as MS-DOS Comma Separated again.\n 7. Once you’ve saved the data into the new file, you can close it and rename it to “students.csv” (the required file name for\n    uploading to Clever).\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEXTRA COMMAS IN FIELD VALUES\n\nYour data may sometimes include a comma within a field value (e.g., if a student’s last name is “Potter, Jr.”), and the\ncomma-separated values file will treat the comma as a field separator unless the entire field value is enclosed in double\nquotation marks.\n\n\nThe following record would NOT be processed to Clever. The three commas in the data row separate that record into four fields, but\nthere are only three fields in the header row.\n\n\n\nThis record would get skewed to look like this:\n\n \n\nThe following record WOULD be processed to Clever. Enclosing the \"Potter, Jr.\" field value in double (straight) quotation marks\ntells Clever that the entire last name is \"Potter, Jr.\"\n\n \nThis record would be processed as:\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLEADING ZEROS\n\nNumerical values (in fields like ‘school_id’, ‘student_id’, and ‘teacher_id’) often begin with “0”, but Excel removes these\nleading zeros, which changes the value listed for that field. For example, student_id “009844” becomes “9844”. When uploaded,\nClever no longer recognizes that student: student “009844” is deleted and a new student, “9844”, is created.\n\nOnce this incorrect data, caused by leading zeros, is uploaded to Clever, it may cause a hold due to changes in data. If the hold\nis approved, those unique SIS IDs can cause many issues, such as users or sections being re-created and losing their associated\nhistorical data in connected apps.\n\nIf you need to open your CSV file in Excel, import your data as text to avoid dropping leading zeros:\n \n\n 1. In Excel, click Data > Get External Data > Import Text File…\n 2. Browse to select your CSV file and click Get Data.\n 3. Choose Delimited as the file type and click Next.\n 4. Check the “Comma” box as the delimiter and click Next.\n 5. Select all columns in the data preview and change their column data format to “Text”.\n 6. Click Finish.\n\n Please note: Leading zeros are not permitted in the \"grade\" column. Our specifications will error out the value \"01\" and only\naccept \"1\" in the grade field.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Related articles:\n * SFTP & Manual Upload: How do I format my CSV files?\n * SFTP Syncs: SFTP Sync FAQ\n * Sync Reports: Error messages"

Overview\n2. Preparing my Clever sync to accept OneRoster files\n3. Syncing student contacts via OneRoster\n4. Troubleshooting\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAs a member of the IMS Global Learning Consortium, Clever supports the IMS Global OneRoster standard. Districts can send OneRoster\n1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 formatted CSV files over Clever’s secure SFTP data pipeline. Clever is the easiest and most secure way for\ndistricts to support OneRoster - with the full confidence of our proven platform and without compromise in functionality or\ncontrol of data security.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPREPARING MY CLEVER SYNC TO ACCEPT ONEROSTER FILES\n\n1. Reach out to Clever Support and our team will work with you to create a timeline and transition plan to OneRoster. Please let\nus know whether you will be using the OneRoster 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 formats for your files. \n\n2. Whether you are new to Clever or transitioning your sync type, you will be provided with a field mapping document. This\ndocument will outline the OneRoster fields that will translate to the Clever fields required by your applications.\n\n * Please note: Clever supports receiving student data in OneRoster CSV 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 formats. In order to ensure compatibility\n   with the evolving standard, Clever is strict in its interpretation of OneRoster 1.0/1.1/1.2. Official formatting for 1.1 can be\n   found here.\n * Required files:\n\n 1. academicSessions.csv\n\n 2. classes.csv\n\n 3. courses.csv\n\n 4. demographics.csv\n\n 5. enrollments.csv\n\n 6. orgs.csv\n\n 7. users.csv\n\n 8. manifest.csv (Note that this file contains all the files Clever is expecting in the sync overall, which should be the 7 listed\n    above.)\n\n3. Automate the transmission of OneRoster CSVs to a folder in your Clever SFTP box. For OneRoster 1.0, the subdirectory should be\ntitled oneroster. For OneRoster 1.1-formatted files, the subdirectory should be titled oneroster11. For OneRoster 1.2-formatted\nfiles, the subdirectory should be titled oneroster12.\n\n4. Once complete, you can leverage Clever’s data-sharing interface to scope student rosters with applications and personalize your\nClever Portal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNCING STUDENT CONTACTS VIA ONEROSTER\n\nStudent contacts can be synced via the users.csv. To connect a contact to a student, use the agentSourceID as shown below:\n\n\n\n The users.csv spec can be found here: https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-csv-tables#_Toc480293266\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nBelow you can find solutions to common sync errors that may display in your Clever Dashboard.\n\nError Message\n\nSolution\n\n\"A manifest.csv file is required for a OneRoster v1.1 SIS data sync\"\n\nPlease ensure that the manifest.csv is present in the OneRoster zipped file and includes all of the following required files:\n\n• academicSessions.csv\n\n• classes.csv \n\n• courses.csv\n\n• demographics.csv (optional - mark as absent if you're not using this file.) \n\n• enrollments.csv\n\n• orgs.csv\n\n• users.csv\n\n \n\nThe files should all be compressed as a group. Please note that compressing the \"folder\" will trigger this error. \n\n\n If you have any questions, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help!"

If student emails are stored on the Email Configuration page\n           -  Troubleshooting email deletions\n4. Other options\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFor the PowerSchool Auto Sync, student email addresses are not synced by default, but they can be synced using the following\nmethods. However, districts have 3 options to sync student email addresses, depending on where they are housed in PowerSchool.\nDistrict Admins must reach out to Clever Support and request emails to be synced using one of these options.\n\nTo review student email data currently in Clever, District Admins can navigate to the Clever Dashboard > Data Browser > Students\npage and add a filter for students with an email that contains @.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIF STUDENT EMAILS ARE STORED IN A FIELD EXPORTABLE VIA DDE\n\nIf your student emails are stored in a field that is exportable by Direct Database Export (DDE), contact Clever Support with the\nexact field name as it appears in the DDE. Our team can assist with updating your sync to pull student emails from this location.\n\nTo determine if the field is exportable via DDE, please follow these directions. \n\n 1. In PowerSchool, navigate to System > Data Management > Direct Database Export (DDE)\n 2. Select Current Table: Students\n 3. Click Select all records in this table \n 4. Click Export Records\n 5. Review the available fields in the dropdown. If you find the field, please provide the exact name of the field (including\n    capitalization and punctuation) to Clever Support. If you cannot locate the field, it is not exportable via DDE.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIF STUDENT EMAILS ARE STORED ON THE EMAIL CONFIGURATION PAGE\n\nIf student emails are stored on the Email configuration page in PowerSchool, Clever can pull this data with additional PowerSchool\npermissions. The Email configuration page looks similar to this:\n\n\n\nIn order to sync your student email addresses, we'll need you to enable page level-permissions for Quick Export. \n\n1. Navigate to System > Security > Access to Page Permissions (/admin/security/changepageaccesspriv.html). Set Turn modify\npermissions = On and click Submit. \n\n\n \n2. Navigate to Quick Exports: System > Page and Data Management > Quick Export (admin/importexport/exportstudents.html).\nClick Modify access privileges.\n\n\n \n3. Find the security group assigned to Clever and set Level of Access to Full. Click Submit (The security group should be the\ngroup assigned to the PowerSchool user you've shared with Clever).\n\n\n  \n4. Navigate to System > Security > Access to Page Permissions (/admin/security/changepageaccesspriv.html). Set Turn modify\npermissions = Off and click Submit. \n\n\n\n\n5. To confirm the permissions, log in to PowerSchool using the credentials provided to Clever. Navigate to Quick Exports: System >\nPage and Data Management > Quick Export (admin/importexport/exportstudents.html). If permissions were correctly applied, the\nClever user account should have access to the Submit button. \n\nIn the Clever Dashboard, navigate to Sync > Settings and press Sync Now. You can review the results on the Sync page once the sync\ncompletes (15-20 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TROUBLESHOOTING EMAIL DELETIONS\n\n\nWhen your district chooses to sync student emails via the Email Configuration page, this is a separate process from the rest of\nyour sync. For some districts, on occasion, our system may fail to successfully sync all student emails, resulting in some student\nemails being deleted from Clever. If this occurs, try rerunning a sync by navigating to your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings\npage and pressing Sync Now. This should resolve the issue.\n\nIf your district regularly encounters issues with student email deletions, contact our team and we can discuss applying a safety\nthreshold for the sync. For example, we can reject the email sync if more than 10% of student emails fail to export, preventing\nlarge changes to active Clever email data. Please contact our support team if you would like to learn more.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nOTHER OPTIONS\n\nIf emails are not exportable via DDE or the Email Configuration page, Clever will not be able to pull student emails as part of\nthe auto sync. However, you do have the ability to manually sideload emails! \n\nPlease see the following Help Center article to upload student emails: How do I upload emails that are not in my SIS?."

Default Field Mappings\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article provides information on the setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the Infinite Campus API sync. If you utilize\nor plan to utilize this sync, please note:\n\n * Your system version\n   * Clever pulls data from Infinite Campus via the OneRoster Provisioning API, which is free for districts. In order to sync your\n     data through the OneRoster API you'll need to make sure your Infinite Campus is on version 1733 or higher.\n          •  Districts using OneRoster provisioning prior to Campus 1733 are free to continue using it\n          •  District who were not using OneRoster provisioning prior to Campus 1733 may contact Campus Support to have the\n     functionality enabled\n * Which version of OneRoster you plan to utilize. 1edtech (formerly IMS Global) has released the final version of the OneRoster\n   v1.2 format. See below for information on how to set up your connection with OneRoster 1.2 or how to upgrade your existing\n   connection.\n\nThe Infinite Campus API Sync:\n\n * Runs every six hours, by querying the OneRoster API\n * Syncs all students who are designated as \"active today\" (activeToday = 1)\n * Syncs all active staff members (employment.active = 1)\n * Supports co-teachers for sections (sectionInfo_teacherPersonID, sectionInfo_teacher2PersonID, etc)\n * Students and teachers need Infinite Campus Portal accounts in order to sync to Clever (see below)\n * Support custom field mappings (please contact Clever Support to set this up)\n * The available fields can be found here\n\nPlease Note: Infinite Campus OneRoster API sync cannot sync ell_status, frl_status, and iep_status. They can be manually uploaded\nvia Custom data. Visit this article for instructions. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENT: USER (PORTAL) ACCOUNTS\n\nIn order for a person to be accessible in the Infinite Campus OneRoster API (and thus synced to Clever) the person needs a User\n(Portal) account in Infinite Campus.\n\nFor documentation on creating user accounts, please review this documentation. To create user accounts in bulk, please review this\ndocumentation.\n\nTo verify if a person has a user account, search for the user in Infinite Campus. If the person has a username, they have a user\naccount. In the example below, \"Amelkin, Federique\" has a user account but \"Freda, Irene\" does not. As a result, \"Freda, Irene\"\nwill not be accessible to Clever via the Infinite Campus OneRoster API. To add a user account in Infinite Campus, click Add User. \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\n\n1. OBTAIN API CREDENTIALS\n\nIn order to configure the API sync you'll first generate API credentials in Infinite Campus: \n\n 1. Navigate to Instruction > Settings > Digital Learning Application Configuration (or System Administration > Learning\n    Interoperability in the Classic Navigation)\n 2. Click Add Application, scroll to the bottom, and click Connect to Other Applications\n 3. Enter Clever as the application name  \n 4. Click Generate New OneRoster Connection  \n 5. For OneRoster version, select your OneRoster version > Generate \n 6. Share ClientID, Client Secret, Base URL and Token URL \n\n   \n\n Please Note: If you already have connected Infinite Campus to Clever and would like to move from OAuth 1.0 OneRoster v1.2 with\nOAuth 2.0, please go to your Sync > Settings page and click the Upgrade button. Then, start at step 4 in the directions above.\nAfter moving to OneRoster 1.2 with OAuth 2.0, we recommend deleting or disabling your old connection that used OAuth 1.0.\n \n\nIMPORTANT Regarding Staff: Before upgrading, be sure to check that any non-instructional staff you wish to include are associated\nwith one of the following roles in Infinite Campus: counselor, districtadministrator, principal, siteadministrator,\nsystemadministrator, or proctor. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n2. CHANGE SYNC TYPE OF CLEVER ACCOUNT\n\nIf you already have a Clever account and are switching to the API sync, please contact Clever Support. In your message, please\nspecify which version of OneRoster (v1.1 or v1.2) you plan to use. Our team will need to switch your account sync type before you\ncan move forward. If you are just getting started with Clever, the IC API sync will be the default when you choose your sync type\nfor your account. You're free to move on to the next step!\n\n\n\n3. ENTER API CREDENTIALS IN CLEVER\n\nPlease note: Infinite Campus has updated its URL format for the API sync. In order to continue to successfully sync to Clever\nusing Infinite Campus API, you'll need to input or update your URL in Clever using the format listed below.\n\n\nOnce your account's sync type is the IC API sync, please take the credentials for the API and enter them into the Sync Settings\npage in your Clever Dashboard:\n\n * Base URL: Enter the base URL copied from Infinite Campus \n   * For OneRoster v1.2, the URL should look like this: https://<portaldomain>/campus/api/oneroster/v1p2/<appName>/ims/oneroster\n   * For your OneRoster v1.1, the URL should look like this:\n      https://<portaldomain>/api/oneroster/v1p1/<appName>/ims/oneroster/v1p1\n * Client ID: Enter the Client ID copied from Infinite Campus\n * Client Secret: Enter the Client Secret copied from Infinite Campus\n * Confirm Client Secret: Enter the Client Secret copied from Infinite Campus  \n\n\n4. SYNC\n\nOnce you input and save your sync credential, the sync will automatically begin running and complete within approximately 30\nminutes. You can also click the Sync Now on the Sync Settings page to start a sync at any time. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf an entire record is missing, we recommend checking the following:\n \n\nRecord Type\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nStudent\n * Must have an active Infinite Campus User (Portal) account\n * Check that the student's Enrollment = Active\n * Must have a username populated in the useraccount.personID field in Infinite Campus\n * Make sure the student's enrollment start and end dates are in the active school year\n * The student's enrollment must not be flagged as a no show\n * The student must have person and current identity records\n * Make sure the student has a valid grade level designation\n * The following data items associated with the student’s enrollment must not be marked external LMS exclude: School, Calendar,\n   Schedule Structure, Enrollment, and Grade Level\n\nStudent Contacts\n * Must have Infinite CampusUser (Portal) account\n * Also have to be listed as Type = Guardian\n * Each guardian must have the \"Portal\" checkbox checked under their student's relationship tab\n\nTeacher\n * Must have an active Infinite Campus User (Portal) accoun\n * Check that EmploymentAssignment = Active\n * Check that the District Assignment start and end dates are valid\n * Assignment must be flagged as Teacher (Users > Status / Role)\n\n\nTeachers are associated with schools based on their sections. If a teacher does not have any assigned sections and needs to be\nassociated with multiple schools, Clever recommends syncing the user as \"Staff\". Please see the requirements below to sync a user\nas \"Staff\" from Infinite Campus. As an alternative, a user can also be added to Clever and associated to multiple schools using\nClever's custom staff feature.StaffThe user's District Assignment in Infinite Campus must meet all the following requirements:\n * Start Date and End Date are inclusive of current date\n * Username field must be populated\n * The record must have an email address\n * At least one flag other than 'Teacher' checked. 'Teacher' can be checked. (If 'Teacher' is checked, both a teacher and staff\n   account will be provisioned for the user.)\n * A user must be associated with one of the following roles to be considered Staff: counselor, districtadministrator, principal,\n   siteadministrator, systemadministrator, or proctor\n\nSchool\n * The API sync only pulls the Primary master schedule, so if you have more than one master schedule at a site, each must be\n   created as their own school instance\n * Check active status: District.Inactive !=1 or District.Inactive is null\n\nSection\n * Check active status: Trial.Active=1 + Course.Active=1 + SchoolYear.Active=1\n * Check whether the section's term is current\n * Section must have a primary teacher and there must be at least one student enrolled\n\n\nIf the record (student, teacher, section) is in Clever but data is missing or incorrect for the record (i.e. incorrect email,\nmissing username), navigate to the Sync > Settings page in your Clever Dashboard. Under Sync Controls, click View defaults.\n\n\nHere you can view which fields Clever is pulling for each record and field. In the below example: \n \n\n 1. If a teacher's email address was incorrect, confirm the email is correct in the \"contact.email\" field in Infinite Campus\n 2. If a teacher is missing State_teacher_id, you will see that Clever does not have this data available to us via the OneRoster\n    API. Please contact Clever Support to see what options may be available to pull this data. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSCHOOL YEAR/TERM ROLLOVER\n\nThe Infinite Campus API sync requires that students be active in order to be synced through the API.\n\n\nOnce a school year ends, students are no longer active in Infinite Campus. This causes the synced data to no longer\ninclude enrollments or student files. You may see the following error in your Dashboard: \"Encountered zero students data\". \n\n\nOnce students and other record types are marked \"Active\" in Infinite Campus for the next school year, the sync will resume as\nexpected.\n\n\nAlternatively, Clever will pull data 21 days prior to the beginning of the district's next active academic session. For example,\nif school begins on August 22nd, Clever will pull the upcoming data on August 1st.\n\n\nTo preserve access for your users between school years, Clever recommends that you put your sync on pause during the summer\nto prevent deletions.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDEFAULT FIELD MAPPINGS\n\nPlease note: Infinite Campus OneRoster v1.2 has released a UI checkbox that when checked \"Legal Names\" are used over preferred\nnames. When not checked, preferred names will be sent to Clever. To access this navigate to: Digital App Configuration > Select\nClever app > Edit > Connection Configuration in Infinite Campus.\n\nBelow are the default field mappings for Infinite Campus OneRoster API syncs that are managed by Clever If you'd like to customize\nyour field mappings, please contact Clever Support. If your district uses the Infinite Campus Auto Sync to sync data to Clever,\nplease see this article.\n \n\n * If a field is blank, the field is either not pulled by default, or not accessible to Clever\n * If you want to change a field mapping, please contact Clever Support to learn what options are available. \n * If a field is not coming through with the correct value, Clever Support may need to complete a value mapping. This is common\n   for: Grade, FRL_Status, ELL_Status, and IEP_Status.\n\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDsch_schoolGUIDSchool_Namesch_nameSchool_Numbersch_schoolNumberState_IDsch_schoolNumberLow_Grade High_Grade Principal Principal_Email School_Address School_City School_State School_Zip School_Phone \n\n\n \n\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDcalendar.schoolIDStudent_IDuseraccount.personIDStudent_Numberperson.studentNumberState_ID First_Nameidentity.firstNameMiddle_Name Last_Nameidentity.lastNameGradeenrollment.gradeGenderidentity.genderGraduation_Year DOBidentity.birthDateRaceidentity.raceEthnicityFed=2\nidentity.raceEthnicityFed=3\nidentity.raceEthnicityFed=4\nidentity.raceEthnicityFed=5\nidentity.raceEthnicityFed=6\nidentity.raceEthnicityFed=7Hispanic_Latinoidentity_hispanicEthnicityHome_Language ELL_Status FRL_Status IEP_Status Student_Street Student_City Student_StatestateIDStudent_Zip Student_Emailcontact.emailUsernameuserAccount.userNamePassword Unweighted_GPA Weighted_GPA \n\n\n \n\n\nTEACHERS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDemploymentAssignment.SchoolIDTeacher_IDuseraccount.personIDTeacher_Numberperson.staffNumberState_Teacher_IDstateIDTeacher_Emailpcontact.emailFirst_Nameidentity.firstNameMiddle_Name Last_Nameidentity.lastNameTitle UsernameuserAccount.UserNamePassword \n\n\n \n\n\nSECTIONS\n\nClever\n\nInfinite Campus\n\nSchool_IDschool.schoolIDSection_IDsection.sectionIDTeacher_IDSectionStaffHistory.PersonID (must have \"P\" in\nSectionStaffHistory.StaffType field)Teacher_2_ID, Teacher_3 ID, etc.SectionStaffHistory.PersonID (secondary teachers will need to\nhave \"T\" in the SectionStaffHistory.StaffType field)NameClever-generated: Course.Number + Section.Number +\nCourse.NameSection_NumberSection.TeacherDisplayGradeClever generated using average grade level of students\nenrolledCourse_Namecourse_nameCourse_Numbercourse.courseIDCourse_Description PeriodsectionSchedule.periodStartSubjectCourse.CoreSubject\n- if not core then course.subjectTypeTerm_Nameterm.termIDTerm_Startterm.StartDateTerm_Endterm.EndDate"

FAQs\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article is an overview of how Clever admins can set up an automated sync with the district’s Active Directory server to sync\nnon-instructional staff and school admins to Clever as \"staff” users.\n\nThis sync between Active Directory and Clever will supplement any existing syncs between the district’s SIS and Clever and\nwill only be used to sync non-instructional staff users (i.e. non-teaching staff).\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n 1. Your district utilizes an Active Directory server to manage non-instructional staff and school admins.\n 2. The Active Directory Sync toggle has been enabled from your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Staff tab.\n\n Once the Active Directory Sync toggle is enabled, non-instructional staff and school admins cannot be created through a manual\nCSV upload. Clever will thereafter ignore any staff.csv or admins.csv files that may continue to be uploaded by the district.\nHowever, the custom staff feature will continue to work for individual account creation. Staff already uploaded to Clever via CSV\nwill be preserved, and migrated to custom staff. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nACTIVE DIRECTORY STAFF SYNC PREPARATIONS\n\nStaff sharing rules in Clever\n\nIf you already have non-instructional staff in Clever, make sure your staff and school admin sharing permissions are in a good\nplace for all of your district’s connected applications, so we’re not unintentionally sharing new users en masse.\n\nFor additional information, please visit:  Staff Setup: Sharing staff with applications\n\n\nExisting staff in Clever\n\nIf your district has already synced staff to Clever via a staff.csv or admins.csv file, please make sure their 'Staff_id' stays\nthe same if you'd like to preserve their historical data in Clever. This field is the key identifier for staff members in Clever\nso, if an existing user is synced from Active Directory with a different 'Staff_id', a new account will be created for them in\nClever. \n\n\nCreate a new bind account\n\nCreate a new bind account with read-only permissions that Clever can use to query your LDAP server. Once created, take note of the\naccount's userDN (i.e. users distinguishedName) and password found in the Attribute Editor - you’ll need that for setup!\n\n\nReview your OU structure in Active Directory\n\nIdentify whether classroom teachers are grouped in Organizational Units (OUs) together with non-instructional staff members.\n\n * If not, that’s great! Take note of the OU names that include only non-instructional staff.\n * If so, there’s a risk of creating additional user accounts in Clever for those who are already in Clever as teachers! This\n   means that users would have both a teacher and a staff account in Clever. To counter this:\n   1. We suggest bulk-adding an extension attribute to staff member’s profiles that would distinguish these two staff types from\n      one another in your server (e.g. extensionAttribute = 'staff' if non-instructional and 'teacher' if instructional).\n   2. Once the extension attribute is added, the attribute can be used in an LDAP filter during step 2 of the setup below - The\n      staff query.\n\nCreate a one-time school mapping CSV file\n\nWe need a one-time upload to map existing schools in Clever to school names in Active Directory. The file should have two columns:\n\n * School_sis_id (as it appears in Clever)\n * Active_directory_name (should correspond to the field your query will be pulling for school)\n\n\n\nYou can locate the school_sis_id or school_id in Clever on the school's profile page:\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP THE SYNC TO CLEVER\n\n * Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Staff Data tab\n * Toggle on 'Active Directory Sync'  to reveal a new setup tab \n * Select 'set up active directory sync' to configure the Active Directory sync in 4 steps\n\n         \n\n * Step 1: Configure the connection between Clever and your district’s Active Directory server by entering your district’s LDAP\n   URL and port, certificate fingerprints, and the users DN and password for the read-only bind account set up in preparation. All\n   of these steps are required to establish the connection. \n * Step 2: Add staff queries to designate the OUs from which Clever should sync staff user accounts. Districts can set up multiple\n   queries if needed, as well as set up filters to scope down the information pulled. For help writing your LDAP filter, see this\n   article. An example is shown below:\n   \n   During this step, you’ll also indicate which Active Directory user attributes should map to the available Clever staff fields. \n * Step 3: Optionally configure a sync for staff extension/custom fields such as security group, building code, etc. The Clever\n   extension field will always begin with ‘ext.’\n * Step 4: Upload your prepared school mapping CSV so we will be able to link the existing school sis_ids in your district’s\n   Clever account with the appropriate school names in Active Directory.\n\nPlease note: If you'd like to add staff with multiple school associations in Clever, you can select a field in Active Directory\nthat contains multiple values separated by commas. As long as these values are contained in the school mapping CSV from step 4,\nour system will parse these out and assign the staff user accordingly to the multiple schools within Clever.\n\n\nAfter the sync is configured and a first sync runs, you can view the results on the Sync > Active Directory tab. Syncs will run\nautomatically every 24 hours but can be triggered from the Active Directory tab as needed. Like your normal SIS Sync report, you\ncan track staff account creations, updates, deletions, and errors from this tab. \n \n\n By default, if a user account from Active Directory does not have a school association, Clever will assign the staff member to\nthe Clever-generated 'Default District Office' school site. To prevent this, please populate a school in the user attribute chosen\nfor the staff school field mapping in step 2 above. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nFAQS\n\nIf syncing staff from Active Directory is enabled, what will happen to existing staff accounts?\n\n * If enabled, existing staff accounts that were uploaded via a staff.csv will be preserved and will be transitioned to \"Custom\n   Staff\". These records will display under Support tools > Custom data > Staff. All custom staff that were created prior to\n   Active Directory being enabled will also be preserved. \n\nIf syncing staff from Active Directory is disabled, what will happen to existing staff accounts?\n\n * If disabled, any staff added to Clever via Active Directory will be removed from Clever upon the next sync with your district's\n   student information system (SIS). The only staff that will remain in Clever are those that were created as Custom Staff:\n   Support tools > Custom data > Staff\n\nIf syncing staff from Active Directory, can I manually add custom staff?\n\n * Yes. If Active Directory sync is enabled, staff can still be manually created by navigating to Support tools > Custom data >\n   Staff\n\nHow often does the Active Directory staff sync run?\n\n * Once daily, but on your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Staff tab, you'll have the option to manually sync data at any time if you\n   need a user to be updated immediately.\n\nWhat happens during a sync pause if I am syncing staff from Active Directory?\n\n * Your staff will continue to sync from Active Directory even during a pause.\n\nWhat should I do if a staff user is not syncing via the Active Directory sync and is missing in Clever?\n\n * Please be sure to review your OUs to ensure that the staff user is in an OU that is set to sync to Clever. If you've confirmed\n   the user is in a selected OU, please contact support.\n\nCan I sync staff via Entra ID instead of Active Directory?\n\n * Clever does not currently provide instructions or support for syncing staff users via Entra ID."

Rostering data from the previous school year (Spring, second semester, Q4, etc.) is typically paused over the summer in order\n    to preserve access to learning applications and resources for students, teachers, and staff not enrolled in summer school.\n 2. Rostering data for summer school. In order to maintain both rosters in Clever, we recommend that districts pause their regular\n    Clever sync and supplement their summer school rosters using custom data.\n\n \n\nTo set up your Clever account for summer, you'll need to review:\n\n * Step 1: Application requirements\n * Step 2: Sync settings\n * Step 3: Creating data\n * Step 4: Final details\n\n\nAll steps must be completed in order to ensure student, teacher, and staff access during the summer.\n\nTo get started configuring your Clever account for summer school, please move on to Step 1: Application requirements."

This can be helpful in cases such as summer school, organizing unique groups of students, and adding staff members\nwho are not in the district’s information system. Custom data can be created, edited, and browsed from the Custom Data page at\nClever Dashboard > Support tools > Custom data.\n \n\nPlease note: Custom data should not duplicate data that is already in Clever that is synced by your SIS. If a user or a section is\nalready in Clever, do not add it to your custom data. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nHOW DOES CUSTOM DATA SUPPORT ROSTERING FOR SUMMER SCHOOL?\n\nWe know that many districts house summer school data outside of the SISs or CSV data files used during the school year. Custom\ndata enables you to easily upload new summer rosters into Clever without reconfiguring the regular school-year sync. Custom data\nalso allows you to consistently update summer school data while \"freezing\" previous school-year data in Clever via the sync pause.\n\nIf you plan to add new summer school users and sections to Clever and share them with learning applications after your sync is\npaused you’ll need to use custom data. Please note, you will only need to upload custom students, teachers, and staff if the users\nare not already synced to Clever. \n\nPlease note: If you pause your sync for specific app(s), custom data will not be shared with any apps you pause the sync for.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW CAN I UPLOAD CUSTOM DATA?\n\nThe easiest way to upload custom data is usually by manually uploading custom data in the Clever Dashboard.\n\nYou can also upload data via your SFTP client if you use the SFTP sync type by following these directions: \n\n 1. Log in to your SFTP client.\n 2. Enter your Clever SFTP credentials. If you don’t have them handy, you can access them in Clever under Dashboard > Sync >\n    Settings. \n 3. Upload your custom data. If you’re new to adding custom data, reference the following Help Center articles: \n    * Custom Data: Sections \n    * Custom Data: Teachers\n    * Custom Data: Staff\n    * Custom Data: Students\n\nBefore getting started, there are a few important points to keep in mind: \n\n * Schools cannot be added via custom data. Please ensure all necessary school sites are syncing from your SIS before any sync\n   pauses.\n * You can bulk upload custom teachers, staff, students, sections, and enrollments via the Clever Dashboard or SFTP. \n * Custom students cannot be added to existing non-custom sections.   \n * Co-teachers can be added manually to custom sections. \n * You can bulk upload extension fields. Adding extension fields may help with setting up sharing rules. \n\n\nLearn more about how to upload custom data here.\n \n\n\nThe final step of the process is Stage 4: Final details"

    "content": "Every application that your schools will want to use during the summer has different considerations for how they support Summer\nSchool. This section breaks down some of the common circumstances and suggests guiding questions you can ask your app partner to\nmake sure your district has all the information you need to offer that app this summer.\n \n\nPlease note: If you want to pause syncing your data to a particular application, please see this article: For Clever Admins:\nPausing your sync for a specific app.  This is a perfect tool for semester rollover and summer school, but shouldn't be confused\nwith an SIS sync pause. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n⚙️ INTEGRATION DETAILS\n\nYou will want to speak with your application partners about their Clever integrations as part of preparing for summer school.\nCertain realities of summer school (such as students transferring to a new campus) can provide difficulties for the ways in which\napplications process your data. Your district will want to reach out to your application partners as soon as possible to plan for\nany of these considerations. \n\n\nQuestions for your app partners:\n\n * Does your application accept students enrolled at multiple schools and/or sections?\n * Does your application accept Clever’s extension fields?\n * Does your application recommend specific sharing permissions? \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n⚠️ DATA REQUIREMENTS\n\nEvery application has slightly different data requirements. While some require just first name, last name, and class associations,\nothers may require further data points.\n\nMake sure to ask your vendors what data is required for summer school and if it is different than during the rest of the year to\navoid needing to make last-minute changes to your rosters to meet requirements.\n\nQuestions for your app partners:\n\n * What data is required for accounts to be generated?\n * What data is recommended to take full advantage of your application features?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n📑 CONTRACT\n\nCheck with your procurement department and/or the application “owner” at the district to confirm your contract terms. Some\ncontracts are due for renewal during the summer which might mean a new contract is needed to maintain service, even if your sync\nis paused. Other contracts might limit the number of users your district has access to and assigning that application over summer\nschool might exceed that limit. Have a conversation within your district to ensure you are ready for these limitations.\n\nQuestions for your app partners:\n\n * When does our contract for your service expire? Does it include summer school?\n * How many licenses have we purchased for this service? Do we have remaining licenses for summer school?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n📚 CONTENT MAPPING\n\nCertain textbooks require a manual content mapping process after rostering through Clever is complete to ensure the right students\nget the right books. Reach out to your application partner to understand if and how they map content and get tips from their\nexperts on best practices for the summer.\n\nMost apps will require a specific class or course codes to help with that content assignment that may need to be passed to your\nsummer school staff for activation.\n\nQuestions for your app partners:\n\n * Do you require content mapping from Clever? \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nTo continue setting up Clever for summer school, proceed to Step 2: Sync settings"

Review Clever Badge expiration\n\n\n\nSHARING PERMISSIONS\n\nOnce your summer school rosters are finalized in Clever, you’ll need to make sure all of your users have access to the right\napplications. In your Clever Dashboard, review the sharing rules for each application, taking care to ensure that these new\nsections, students, teachers, and staff are shared with the applications they need. \n\nQuestions to ask: \n\n * Which applications do we need to use over the summer?\n * Who needs to use these apps?\n * How can we easily identify and share summer school users? (Recommended: extension fields)\n\nView instructions for adjusting sharing permissions here. \n\nPlease note, when \"Sharing by Schools\", sections with a school association that is different from a teacher's primary school will\nnot be shared. For example, a teacher has sections at two schools: School A and School B. If the sharing permissions for the\napplication are set to share School A, only the teacher's section at School A will be shared. This is important for teachers that\nwill be providing instruction at an alternate school location during summer school. \n \n\nClever Tip: We recommend using a \"Share by Rules\" sharing type for summer school data.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nNOTIFY TEACHERS \n\nWe highly recommend notifying teachers of your summer school plan! You can use templates found here.\n \n\nPlease note: When you start your new school year in Clever, our system will automatically update any teacher pages shared with\nspecific sections to “Just me” sharing. This excludes “Just Me” and “All sections” pages. We recommend you notify your teachers so\nthey can take action. Learn more here.\n\n\nClever's announcements tool is available to all districts and delivers notifications directly to students and teachers in the\nClever Portal. To learn more about announcements, please see this article.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nUPDATE TECH SUPPORT CONTACT \n\nChanges in personnel and procedures often occur at the end of the school year. Please review your district tech support contact to\nensure students and teachers are able to receive help from your team if needed. Directions for updating your tech support contact\ncan be found here. \n\nIf new administrators will be joining your Clever team, have them check out our quick start guides in Clever Academy! \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREVIEW CLEVER BADGE EXPIRATION\n\nBy default, Clever voids all student Badges after a district's student information system (SIS) summer sync pause has ended,\nexcept for districts that choose to opt-out of this recommended practice. Voiding Badges is a critical security measure that helps\nto keep student information secure from one school year to the next. If you opt-out of invalidation, we highly recommend that you\nchange your settings. \n\n\nTo ensure your Clever Badges are safe and secure from this year to the next:\n\n1. Navigate to SSO & Portal > Badges > Settings > Security\n\n2. Click Edit\n\n \n\n3. Ensure the yearly Badge expiration toggle is green with a checkmark.\n\n\n \n\n4. Click Save\n\n\n\nFor districts that do not choose to opt-out of the summer Badge invalidation process, student Badges will be invalidated when the\ndistrict's summer sync pause ends."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n 1. Overview\n2. How does SSO authentication work?\n3. Single sign-on (SSO) Requirements\n4. Additional SSO options\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever single sign-on (SSO) enables users to securely authenticate into connected applications via Clever Portal. Users log into\nClever just once with one set of credentials, or using a Clever Badge, and then click on the various app icons to be logged in\nautomatically via SSO. Clever application partners rely on Clever's verification system of determining that a user is, indeed, who\nthey say they are.  Without Clever SSO, each application would need to maintain its own database of users and their credentials. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DOES SSO AUTHENTICATION WORK?\n\n * A user logs in to Clever via the district's Identity Provider (IDP) (e.g. Active Directory, Google, etc.) from the Clever login\n   page.\n * Clever authenticates the user through the district's IDP.\n * If the user is verified, Clever creates a \"token\" (i.e. a piece of data) that identifies the user and then logs them\n   in successfully.\n * The user then clicks on the appropriate application icon to open an application, and Clever provides the user's token to the\n   application which authenticates the user. This means the user does not need to enter login credentials a second time. \n * The user is logged into the application successfully!\n\nClever Tip: The Clever Portal also supports universal single sign-on for non-integrated Clever applications via SSO (Saved\nPasswords) authentication. Read more about this here!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHO CAN USE SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO)?\n\nThe following users can access applications through Clever single sign-on (SSO):\n\n * Students\n * Teachers\n * Staff\n * District admins\n\nPlease note that each individual learning application determines which of the user types listed above they support. Some apps only\nsupport two or three user types.\n\nTo find out which user types are supported by an application, navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Home page, and click on the\napplication name to open the app overview page. If a user type is not listed under 'SSO Supported User Types', users of that type\nwill not be able to access the application through Clever.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) REQUIREMENTS\n\nThere are certain requirements that should be met in order to ensure a seamless Clever single sign-on (SSO) experience for users:\n\n1. Users must have a record in Clever (via Secure Sync)\n\n * In order for users to be able to log in, they must have an existing record in Clever. For more information on syncing rostering\n   data to Clever, please see What is Secure Sync?\n\nPlease note: For best results, make sure that there is only one record for each user in Clever. If there are multiple records in\nClever for the same user, users may not be able to log in. The only caveats to this are teachers who are also considered staff and\nhave both a teacher and staff account in Clever, or district admins who are also teachers or staff.\n\n\n2. District Portal URL\n\n * Each district has the ability to customize a unique Clever login page URL to share with district users. This URL is a direct\n   way for users to log in rather than navigating to Clever.com and selecting their school. Custom URLs are in the format\n   of https://clever.com/in/<YOUR CUSTOM SHORTNAME> (e.g. https://clever.com/in/northernschooldistrict) \n * Your district's Portal URL can be customized from the Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Portal settings page in Clever. Visit\n   this article for additional instructions.\n\n\n\n\n3. Configure your Clever SSO login method (Identity Provider)\n\n * For help determining which Identity Provider (IDP) your district should use and how to set it up, please see these articles: \n   * Single Sign-On (SSO): Identity Provider (IDP) Options\n   * Single Sign-On (SSO): Setup & Configuration\n\n4. Tech Support Contact\n\n * To abide by Clever's stringent security and data policies, Clever support will never provide user login credentials through any\n   of our communications channels if a district user reaches out to us direct. \n * For this reason, each district should have a Tech Support contact for users to contact in case of Clever login issues. This\n   information can be updated from your Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings page.\n\n          \n\n * The Tech Support contact information will be displayed in your district's 'Get help logging in' page. Please visit these\n   articles for help troubleshooting user login issues.\n\n           \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDITIONAL SSO OPTIONS\n\nAllowing users to access Clever applications via your existing district portal, website or Learning Management System (LMS)\n\n * Single sign-on (SSO) is designed to work with your existing district portal or website. You can allow users to authenticate\n   into applications without using the Clever Portal by embedding single sign-on  URLs (i.e. Instant Login Links) into your\n   portal, website, or Learning Management System (LMS).\n * For information on Instant Login Links, please visit: Single Sign-On (SSO): Instant Login links\n\nUsing the 'Log in with Clever' option\n\n * Some applications provide a ‘Log in with Clever’ option from their website login pages and mobile apps. This option allows your\n   users to log in to the application from the app website using their Clever credentials!\n\n        \n\nIf you have any questions about Clever SSO, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help! \n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Clever SSO Policy"

Once users log into Clever, they simply click on an application icon in their Portal and are logged in to the\nlearning app automatically via SSO.\n\n\nFor school districts that use Clever Passwords to log in as well as another Identity Provider (IDP), you can use our SSO Policy to\nassign which users can use Clever Passwords as a login method and which users must use another IDP. This can be helpful for making\nsure your users are logging in with the method that you want them to use.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSSO POLICY SETTINGS\n\nIf your district uses Clever Passwords and another IDP (such as Google or Active Directory) and you only want specific users to be\nable to use Clever Passwords, you can adjust this under Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO Settings > SSO Policy.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDISALLOWED USERS\n\nIf a user who isn’t authorized to use Clever Passwords attempts to log in with Clever Passwords, they’ll receive an error message\nthat indicates they need to use another configured login method. The message isn’t customizable and will recommend they use your\nother configured login method(s).\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER PASSWORDS AND CLEVER MFA+\n\nSetting up your SSO Policy is particularly helpful if you're using Clever Multi-Factor Authentication (Clever MFA+) for teachers\nand staff. Clever MFA+ provides the highest level of account protection when it's used as the front door to log in to all apps\n(including email, SIS, instructional apps, etc.). Likewise, you'll want Clever to be the first app teachers and staff log in to,\nso you'd use Clever Passwords as the IDP.\n\n \n\nFor students who don't yet have access to Clever MFA+, you can have them sign in with an existing IDP, such as Google or Active\nDirectory (since this offers one-click access to Clever), not via Clever Passwords.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Setup & Configuration\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Clever Passwords - Log in with Clever\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): What is SSO?\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Log in with Google\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): \"Log in with Office 365/Entra ID\"\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): \"Log in with LDAPS\"\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): \"Log in with ADFS\"\n\n * For Clever Admins: Clever MFA+ setup"

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nPlease note: Microsoft has changed the name of Azure to Entra ID. We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn addition to logging in using your email address and password at schools.clever.com, admin users can also log into the district\ndashboard and admin Portal using their identity provider (IDP) via single sign-on (SSO). SSO logins use the “Log in with” button\nfrom your Clever Portal URL. This article applies to users with the following roles: Clever Admins, District Curriculum Lead,\nDistrict Help Desk.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nRequirements for admin SSO access:\n\n * You must have an external IDP, such as Google or Entra ID, configured for SSO into Clever on the Login method tab of the SSO\n   Settings page in the district dashboard. You can learn more about configuring SSO here.\n\n\n \n * The email address associated with your admin account as seen on the Profile or Team pages must match the email address in your\n   IDP. See details for your IDP below.\n   * Admins must update their own email addresses from the Profile page. You can learn more about how to update your profile\n     settings here.\n * Your username or login claims rule in your IDP must be your email address.\n\n\nGoogle\nGoogle will always use an email address as the username. If you have added Google as a login method and your admin user email\naddress is a Google email address, you are configured for Clever Dashboard SSO.\n\nEntra ID\nA claims rule for clever.district_admin.email or clever.any.email should be added in Entra ID as outlined here. The claims rule\nshould indicate which field in Active Directory contains the same email address that matches the email address on the Clever\nAdmin's Profile in Clever.\n\nActive Directory\nA claims rule for clever.district_admin.email should be added in Active Directory as outlined here. The claims rule should\nindicate which field in Active Directory contains the same email address that matches the email address on the Clever Admin's\nProfile in Clever.\n\nCanvas\nBy default, Canvas will try to match on email. Ensure that your admins have an email address in Canvas that matches the email\naddress on the Clever Admin's Profile in Clever to enable SSO access with Canvas. If these default matches do not work for your\ndistrict, please let us know in your support request.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLOGGING INTO THE ADMIN CLEVER DASHBOARD AND PORTAL\n\nTo log in as an admin user using SSO, you will need to navigate to your district's Portal URL. This is the URL that your students,\nteachers, and staff use to log in, and can be found on your Portal Settings page. \n\n\n\nWhen logging in directly from your Portal URL, you will first access your admin Clever Portal. To navigate to the Clever\nDashboard, click Dashboard at the top of your Portal.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSSO AND MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)\n\nBy default, district admin users still need to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access the Clever Portal when using SSO\n(learn more about MFA for admin users here). If your district admin team already uses MFA when accessing your identity provider\n(IDP) and you would like to by-pass admin MFA when accessing Clever, contact our support team and be prepared to provide details\nabout your admin team and IDP MFA. Learn more about managing your District Clever Admin Team here.\n\nDisabling password login for your admin team\nAs an additional layer of security, Clever can disable password login for your admin team. This means that email address and\npassword logins will no longer work at schools.clever.com and your team must use SSO through your district Portal URL. If you\nwould like to disable password logins for your district, contact our support team. \n \n\nPlease note: The Clever Account Owner can always use an email address with a password login and MFA to access the Clever\nDashboard. This is to provide a backup in case your IDP configurations change and other admins lose access.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nCan admins use Clever Passwords to log in to the Clever Dashboard?\n\n * No. SSO admin login through the Portal URL must use an external IDP.\n\nSometimes I log in directly to the Clever Dashboard when using SSO. Why does that happen?\n\n * If you start at schools.clever.com and click School Login to navigate to your district Portal URL, you will log into the Clever\n   Dashboard directly instead of the admin Portal.\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * For District Admin: Setting up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Clever Admin\n * Managing your District Clever Admin Team\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Setup & Configuration"

Overview\n2. Single sign-on (SSO) from your district's Clever Portal\n3. SSO from a district website\n4. SSO from an application’s website\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) allows you and your students to access hundreds of applications with one click using your existing Clever\naccount. This way, you only need to remember one set of login credentials.\n\nThere are a few options to use Clever's SSO based on your school or district's setup, listed below.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON FROM YOUR DISTRICT’S CLEVER PORTAL\n\n \nWith your Clever account, you can log in to your district’s Clever Portal, a single page with all of the SSO applications and\nlinks set up for you by your district. \n\nTo access an application, simply click on the icon, and you’ll be taken to the application and logged in automatically. \n \n\nPlease note: You and your students will only see the applications your district has set up for you - if your portal or a student’s\nportal is missing an app, contact your district support contact.\n\n \n\nFor more information on how to access your Clever Portal, see How do I log in to the Clever Portal as a teacher?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nSSO FROM A DISTRICT WEBSITE\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Clever Portal, your district might also embed Clever SSO links into other websites, such as a district website\nor an alternative portal like Stoneware or Encore. In these cases, after clicking on the Clever SSO link, you may be asked to log\nin to Clever. Once you have logged in to your Clever account, you will be taken directly to the application and logged in.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) FROM AN APPLICATION’S WEBSITE\n\n\n\nMany applications will have a way that you can use Clever SSO directly from their login page - you and your students may simply\nclick Sign In with Clever” or Log In with Clever to log in to the application using your Clever account.\n\nIf this is your first time signing in to the application via Clever, and if your district has not already created an account for\nyou in the application, the application may ask to create a new SSO account for you based on your existing Clever account. Similar\nto what you may have experienced before when using “Log in with Google” or “Log in with Facebook,” Clever will ask you if you are\nokay sharing information with the application about yourself and the classes you teach for the purposes of creating SSO accounts:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOnce you click Allow and continue, you will be logged in to the application and will have SSO accounts created for you and your\nstudents! There is no need to manually create accounts or share out class codes. All accounts will be created automatically based\non your classes in Clever.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share the resource with your students, be sure to add the resource to your Teacher Page for easy access."

Before you do, you will want to run one last test to make sure your setup is working properly. This step should only take a\nfew minutes to complete.\n \n\n\nTESTING SSO LOGINS\n\n \n * First, make sure you have the Clever login credentials for a few students and teachers.\n * Then, navigate to your Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings page to copy your district's unique Clever login Portal\n   URL. For instructions on customizing your Portal URL, visit this article.\n * Open an incognito browser window (e.g. Chrome, Firefox & Edge).\n * Paste your district's Portal URL in the address bar and hit enter. This will lead you to your district's unique Clever login\n   page.\n * Attempt to log in as various users to see if you are successful.\n\n \n\n\nTIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n \n * If you’re not able to use an incognito window, a regular browser window is fine. You will just need to make sure you’re logged\n   out of Clever, and any other Identity Providers (e.g. Google, Active Directory), before attempting to log in as another user.\n   Otherwise, you will continue to be logged in to your account rather than the one you are testing.\n * If you don’t have access to student or teacher login credentials, have a small group of teachers test their own logins to see\n   if they are successful. You can share the login instructions with them that are downloadable from your Clever Dashboard > SSO &\n   Portal > Portal settings page.\n * Utilize your Clever Dashboard > Support tools > Login logs to make sure logins are successful, and find information about any\n   errors you’re seeing. You can search for specific users and see more details on what caused the issue. For more about Login\n   Logs, visit this article.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve tested Clever SSO, and have confirmed successful logins, make sure to let your district users know they can log in!\nTrack the success of your rollout from your Clever Dashboard > Analytics page.

They will not see their\n   Clever Portal.\n\n \n * Please note: If a user has already authenticated with your Identity Provider (IDP) and is currently logged in, they will skip\n   the IDP login screen and be taken directly into the app.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFINDING AN APP'S INSTANT LOGIN LINK\n\nDistrict admins can locate an app's Instant Login Link from the Clever Clever Dashboard > Home page by clicking on the name of the\napplication to open the app overview page.  Then navigate to the app 'Settings' tab to locate the link under 'Application\nInformation.' Copy the Instant Login Link to embed into your district portal, website, or LMS.  \n \n\nIf you would like to use the app icon in your district portal, you can download the 'Application Icon' image from this page as\nwell.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that Instant Login links are not available for SSO (Saved Passwords) applications and that each individual learning\napplication determines which of the following user types they support:\n \n\n * Students\n * Teachers\n * Staff\n * Clever District Admins\n\n\nIf a user type is not listed under 'SSO Supported User Types' in the app 'Settings' tab, users of that type will not be able to\naccess the application from your district portal via the Instant Login Link."

Once district users are logged into Clever, they simply click on an application icon in their Portal and are logged\nin to the learning app automatically via SSO.\n\nThe first step in setting up SSO in Clever is to select your district's Identity Provider (IDP).  If your district already uses\none of the Identity Providers listed below, we encourage you to use that one for Clever SSO. If your district prefers to use an\nalternative SSO method, check out Clever Passwords!\n\nOnce you have determined which IDP to use as your Clever SSO method, you will navigate to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO\nsettings to complete the setup.  Click here for a list of helpful articles for setting up and managing Clever SSO for each IDP.\n\nClever Tip: If you need help determining which IDP to use, or setting up Clever SSO, please contact the\nClever Support team for help! \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIDENTITY PROVIDER OPTIONS\n\nBelow is a list of Clever-supported Identity Providers (IDPs).

Learn\nmore here: For District Admin: Google SSO 3rd party confirmation\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever single sign-on (SSO) allows students and teachers to log in using their district email addresses provisioned by\nGoogle. This means users will need to use their district-assigned Google email and password to log in to Clever (not an\n@gmail.com email address).\n \n\nClever Tip: Google authentication supports multiple domains! No special configuration is required. Simply ensure that users'\nschool email addresses are synced to Clever and they will be successfully authenticated into Clever. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\nStep 1: Ensure that all district users have a district-provided Google email address in Clever. To verify this:\n\n * Navigate to the Data Browser to make sure the Email field is populated for district students, teachers, and staff. By using the\n   Add Filter option, you can check to see if emails are populated by choosing the Email value as the Property, Contains as the\n   Operator, and input @ as the value. This will bring up a list of emails for the user type.\n\n           \n \n * Please note: District-provided Google email addresses can be synced to Clever from your student information system (SIS) or\n   side-loaded to Clever, thus bypassing the sync. For more information on side-loading emails, read here. \n\n\nStep 2: District admins can configure the single sign-on (SSO) settings from Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings:\n\n * Select Add Login Method to the far right.\n * Select Google Authentication as the Identity Provider.\n * Confirm the Google email source.\n * Select Save.\n\n           \n\n\nStep 3: Test various users to ensure their login credentials work. To do this: \n\n * Ensure you have the credentials for a few students, teachers or staff.\n * Navigate to your district’s Clever login page.\n * Enter the credentials of the user you are testing.\n * You should be successfully logged into Clever as the user!\n\nOnce the Google login method setup steps are completed, the Google login option will automatically appear on your district's\nClever login page.\n\n\nHERE'S AN INTERACTIVE TUTORIAL\n\n** Best experienced in Full Screen (click the icon in the top right corner before you begin) **\n\nhttps://www.iorad.com/player/1996456/Adding-Google-as-an-Identity-Provider--IDP- \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nOPTIONAL SETTINGS\n\n\n\nGOOGLE EMAIL SOURCE\n\nIf Google email addresses are not stored in your SIS, you can manually upload the emails to Clever in a separate file. To use this\noption, select: Google emails are NOT stored in my district's SIS.\n\nPlease note: manual email upload is not available to districts using Override domain  \n\nTo do this, please follow the instructions in this article: Manually Uploading (i.e. side-loading) User Emails to Clever.\n\n\n\n\nFORCE GOOGLE LOGOUT WHEN USERS LOG OUT OF CLEVER\n\nIf your district is using Google as your identity provider (IDP), you can apply a setting from your Clever SSO settings page that\nwill automatically log users out of Google when they log out of Clever. This is helpful in situations where multiple users are\nlogging in to Clever on shared devices.  When using a shared device, it is important to log the first user out of Google (in\naddition to Clever) before the next user logs in. Otherwise, some devices will not allow the second user to log in. Districts can\nhelp to eliminate this issue by forcing the user's Google logout when they log out of Clever.\n\nWhen enabled:\n\nChrome/Edge/Firefox\n\nWhen a user logs out of Clever, the coinciding Google session will also be terminated and the user will be automatically\nredirected to Clever's login page.\n\nSafari\n\nWhen a user logs out of Clever, they will be redirected to Google's logout page. To begin a new Clever session, users must\nmanually navigate to Clever's login page.\n \n\nTo enable Force Google Logout:\n\n * Navigate to SSO & Portal > SSO Settings and select the Edit settings option for Google.\n * Select Force Google logout when users log out of Clever\n * Select Save.\n\n          \n \n\n For more information about supporting users on shared devices:  Troubleshooting: Issues with Shared Devices\n\n\n \n\n\nAPPEND DOMAIN:\n\nYou can pre-populate your Google domain for users to facilitate even easier logins! Simply use our \"Append Domain\" tool. \n\n 1. Navigate to SSO & Portal > SSO settings > Login method.\n 2. Select Edit settings for Google Authentication\n 3. Check the box for Append my district's Google domain when users sign in\n 4. Enter your district's Google domain without the @ symbol\n 5. Select Save\n\n\n\nOnce complete, users will see your Google domain pre-populated when they select Log in with Google. If your teachers or staff use\na different domain than students, they can override the pre-populated domain by simply typing their entire email address. Once\nthey enter '@,' the prep-populated domain will disappear. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nOVERRIDE GOOGLE DOMAIN:\n\nOccasionally, there are situations where districts change their Google district domain but do not want to update all user email\naddresses in their SIS to the new domain. In cases like this, district admins can provide Clever with the district's new Google\ndomain, and Clever will update user emails behind the scenes!\n\nEmail domain override only supports one domain. Districts that use multiple domains (example: @cleveracademy.com and\n@students.cleveracademy.com) are not supported.\n\n\nPlease note: The email addresses will still show the older domain when viewing a user's profile page in Clever; however, the user\nwill be able to log in using the email address with the new domain. This will only work if users have an email address in Clever,\nand the username remains the same. For example, JaneSmith@district.org could be appended to JaneSmith@schooldistrict.org by Clever\nas long as 'JaneSmith' remains the same.\n\n\nDirections:\n\n * Navigate to SSO & Portal > SSO settings > Login method.\n * Select Edit settings for Google.\n * Select Google email addresses are NOT stored in my district's SIS, click Next\n * Enter your district's Google domain.\n * Select to which user types to override (e.g. Teachers, Students, or both)\n * Once saved, users will use their email with the district domain you have set here to log in to Clever\n\nPlease note: Clever does not have access to any Google passwords for district users, so password-related issues will need to be\nresolved by the district. For troubleshooting tips, please visit: Troubleshooting: Google User Login Issues\n\n \n\n\nInterested in deep-diving into how to best use Clever and Google together?

Setting up Clever as your organization-wide SSO Profile in Google\n        •  Setting up Badges into Chromebooks without additional SSO Profiles\n        •  Setting up Clever to automatically launch on Chromebooks when users enter login credentials\n4. Adding additional identity providers as SSO Profiles in Google\n5. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever works seamlessly with Chromebooks, providing students and teachers access to all their learning applications while only\nlogging in once per device. Google supports several ways to configure utilizing other identity providers (IdPs) within the Google\nAdmin Console. This article covers how to configure Clever as the organization-wide single sign-on (SSO) provider for Google.\n\nIf you’d like to set up Clever as an individual SSO Profile in Google, please see this article.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER AND CHROMEBOOK LOGINS\n\nThere are two login flows for using Clever with Chromebooks:\n\n 1. Students use Clever Badges to log into Chromebooks then access Clever.\n    * Students open their Chromebook and scan their Clever Badge\n    * This automatically logs the students into their Chromebooks and Clever Portals (they do not need to log in again).\n    * Students can click on any learning application to begin their learning session.\n 2. Users log into Chromebooks manually, using credentials, then access Clever.\n    * Users open Chromebooks and log in with their district-provided Google login credentials.\n    * After logging in, the district’s Clever Portal is automatically opened for them (i.e., the user does not need to log in\n      again).\n    * Users can click on any application icon to begin their learning session.\n\nDepending on your preferences, each method can be configured separately for different Organizational Units (OUs) in your Google\nAdmin Console.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP CLEVER AS YOUR ORGANIZATION-WIDE SSO PROFILE IN GOOGLE\n\nThe simplest method to configure either Badges into Chromebooks logins or set up your user’s Chromebooks to automatically launch\nand log them into Clever is to set up Clever as the organization-wide SSO Profile for your Google account.\n\n\n\nIf Clever is set as the organization-wide SSO Profile for your Google accounts, you can add additional SSO profiles for other\nIdPs. You can learn more about this in Google’s support documentation here.\n\n\nSETTING UP BADGES INTO CHROMEBOOKS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SSO PROFILES\n\n \n\n Please note: Clever Badges into Chromebooks are not compatible with Kiosk Mode, and you must have the \"set up SSO with\nthird-party identity provider\" checkbox selected under the Third-party SSO profile for your organization section of Google Admin.\n\n\n 1.  Enable Clever Badges.\n    * Use the left-hand navigation bar of your Clever Dashboard to navigate to SSO Settings > Badges. Select Begin Setup.\n       \n 2. Confirm Google email addresses are populated for students in Clever.\n    \n    * To confirm if email addresses are populated, search for a few test students and confirm on their profile page if the email\n      field is populated.\n      \n      If you utilize a student information system (SIS) Auto Sync and email addresses are missing, please navigate to the Clever\n      Dashboard > Sync > Settings > Field Mappings page to specify which field in your SIS contains student emails. After your\n      next sync, email addresses should be added to Clever. Please note: If you do not see the SIS field name containing student\n      email addresses, contact Clever Support for assistance.\n 3. Configure the Google Admin Console\n    * To open the Chromebooks Setup Wizard, navigate to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Badges > Chromebook > Launch Setup\n      Guide. Follow the directions as outlined in the setup wizard.\n        \n 4. We recommend testing Badges into Chromebooks logins before releasing them to students. For troubleshooting assistance please\n    see our article Single Sign-On (SSO): Chromebooks - Troubleshooting.\n\n\nSETTING UP CLEVER TO AUTOMATICALLY LAUNCH ON CHROMEBOOKS WHEN USERS ENTER LOGIN CREDENTIALS\n\n 1. Clever Setup\n    \n    * Navigate to Portal >  SSO Settings. Confirm Google is configured as a login method. For more information on setting up\n      Google SSO, see this Help Center Article.\n 2. Navigate to the Chromebooks Setup Wizard\n    * Please click here or navigate to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Badges > Chromebook > Launch Setup Guide. We recommend\n      following the directions as outlined in the setup wizard for the best experience.\n 3. Google Admin Dashboard Setup\n    * In your Google Admin Console, visit Chrome User Settings under Device Management. Under Startup, set the homepage URL to\n      match your Clever district login URL (i.e. portal URL).\n     \n 4. We recommend testing login credentials again after configuring the Clever Portal to launch when logging into a Chromebook. If\n    you encounter any errors, please confirm the steps above were configured exactly as indicated in the instructions. If the\n    error continues to occur, please contact Clever Support for further assistance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING ADDITIONAL IDENTITY PROVIDERS AS INDIVIDUAL SSO PROFILES IN GOOGLE\n\nRequirements:\n\nSupport for multiple IdPs is available through these kinds of Google licenses:\n\n * Google Workspace Business Starter, Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise\n   Plus, Education Fundamentals, Education Plus (purchase here), Frontline, and Nonprofits, as well as legacy G Suite Basic and\n   Business customers.\n * Cloud Identity customers.\n * Google for Education Plus + Clever IDM bundle (learn more)\n\n Please note: Adding additional identity providers as individual SSO Profiles in Google is not available to Google Workspace\nEssentials customers or on users' personal Google Accounts.\n\n\n Follow the Badges into Chromebook wizard instructions to make Clever the org-level SSO profile:\n 1. Add additional IdP as a third-party SSO profile.\n 2. Make Google sign-in the default sign-on method in the OU targeting settings (optional).\n 3. Target students and student Chromebook OUs with the org-level profile.\n 4. Target teachers/staff with the additional IdP profile.\n\n\n\nIf you need further assistance, please get in touch with Clever Support by clicking Contact Support in our Help Center.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nWhat is the best way to use Google applications (Docs, Sheets, Drive, etc.) through Clever?\n\n * If you set up Clever and an IdP for Google, please see our article Adding Google SSO applications to provide the best login\n   experience for all Google applications (drive, docs, sheets, etc.).\n\nDo we need to require forced logout upon idle or lid close?\n\n * No. These settings are recommended if devices are being shared by multiple users. If your district is 1:1, you can change these\n   idle settings to Sleep.

Setting up Clever\n\nPlease note: Microsoft has changed the name of Azure to Entra ID. We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTo use single sign-on (SSO) with Entra ID/Office 365, you'll need to make sure you have:\n \n\n * Active SIS sync with Clever\n * Entra ID Premium OR Entra ID and PowerShell Proficiency\n\n\nNot sure if you have Entra ID? If you have a paid subscription to Office 365 for your organization, you have a free subscription\nto Entra ID.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPREPARING FOR SETUP WITH CLEVER\n\nIf you haven't finished signing up for a Clever account yet, you can choose Google to start. Once you have access to the Clever\nDashboard, take the following steps:\n \n\n 1. From your Clever Dashboard menu, click SSO & Portal > SSO settings.\n 2. Choose 'Add Login Method'.\n 3. Choose Active Directory Authentication\n 4. Enter your metadata URL (you can find out how to obtain your metadata URL below)\n 5. Check the box for 'Allow unencrypted SAML assertions'\n 6. Click Save\n 7. Add the contact information for whom students and teachers should reach out to if they have trouble with logging in to Clever\n    - this should be someone who can help them reset their Entra ID credentials and/or make sure they are shared with the\n    application they're trying to access through Clever.\n\n\n 8. Next, navigate to SSO & Portal > Portal settings and choose your district's Portal URL. The URL will be\n    www.clever.com/in/<shortname>;. Remember to use something that your students and teachers will remember easily.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP IN ENTRA ID\n\nYou'll need to configure Entra ID to connect with Clever single sign-on (SSO). In order to do that, you'll need to:\n \n\n * Add the Clever app to Entra ID\n * Set up SSO to the Clever App\n * Set up Claims Rules to allow Clever to match Entra ID users to Clever records\n * Assign users to the Clever App in Entra ID\n\n\nAdding the Clever App to Entra ID\n \n\n 1. To add Clever from the gallery, perform the following steps:\n     \n    \n    1. In the Entra ID portal, on the left navigation panel, click Entra ID icon.\n       \n       \n    \n    2. Navigate to Enterprise applications. Then go to All applications.\n       \n       \n    \n    3.

In other words, a\nlink relationship between an Entra ID user and the related user in Clever needs to be established.\n \n\nIn Clever, assign the value of the user name in Entra ID as the value of the Username to establish the link relationship.\n \n\nConfigure Entra ID single sign-on\n \n\nIn this section, you enable Entra ID single sign-on in the Entra ID portal and configure single sign-on in your Clever\napplication.\n \n\nTo configure Entra ID single sign-on with Clever, perform the following steps:\n \n\n 1. In the Entra ID portal, on the Clever application integration page, find the Manage section and select single sign-on.\n\n 2. On the Select a single sign-on method page, select SAML.\n\n 3. On the Set up single sign-on with SAML page, click the edit/pen icon for Basic SAML Configuration to edit the settings.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n 4. On the Basic SAML Configuration section, enter the values for the following fields:\n     \n    \n    a. In the Identifier (Entity ID) text box, type a URL using the following: https://clever.com/oauth/saml/metadata.xml\n    \n    b. In the Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL) text box, type a URL using either of the\n    following: https://clever.com/* or https://clever.com/oauth/saml/assert\n\n 5. c. In the Sign on URL text box, type a URL using the following pattern: https://clever.com/in/<shortname>;\n 6. \n 7.  \n 8. 5. Next, open the User Attributes & Claims section.\n\n\n\nThere will be required claims that you will not need to adjust at all.\n \n\nAdditional Claims rules are used to allow Clever to determine which student or teacher is logging in. To do this, we match Entra\nID attributes to data in Clever. Claim name will be the Clever field and the value is the field in Entra ID.\n\nIn order for users to be able to log in, there needs to be an attribute for each user type that exactly matches data in a field in\nClever. We recommend adding three claims - one each for: \n\n * Students\n * Teachers\n * Staff\n\nTo view the possible Clever Claim name attribute values for each user type, see this article.\n\n\n\n 6. To generate the Metadata URL, navigate to SAML Signing Certificate and copy the App Federation Metadata URL.\n    \n    \n\n\nGrant users access to Clever\n \n\nIn this section, you will enable students and teachers to use Entra ID single sign-on by granting access to Clever.\n \n\nTo assign users to Clever, perform the following steps:\n \n\n 1. In the Entra ID portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to Enterprise\n    applications then click All applications.\n    \n    \n\n 2. In the applications list, select Clever.\n    \n    \n\n 3. In the menu on the left, click Users and groups.\n    \n    \n\n 4. Click the Add button. Then select Users and groups on Add Assignment dialog.\n    \n    \n\n 5. On the Users and groups dialog, select the appropriate users from the Users list.\n\n 6. Click Select button on the Users and groups dialog.\n\n 7. Click Assign button on the Add Assignment dialog.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP CLEVER\n\n \n\n 1. In a different web browser window, log in to your Clever Dashboard as an administrator.\n\n 2. From the left navigation, click SSO & Portal > SSO settings.\n\n 3. On the SSO Settings page, perform the following steps:\n    \n    a. Select Add Login Method.\n    \n    b. Select Active Directory Authentication.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    c. Enter the Metadata URL you pulled from the Entra ID console in the Metadata URL text box.\n    \n    \n    \n    d. Check the box for Allow unencrypted SAML assertions\n    \n    d. Click Save.\n\n\n If you have any questions about setting up Clever SSO, please reach out to Clever support!

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Requirements\n3. The user experience\n4. Configuring ADFS\n5. Configuring Clever SSO with ADFS\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever single sign-on (SSO) enables users to be securely authenticated into connected applications via their Clever Portal. Users\nlog in to Clever just once with one set of credentials, or using a Clever Badge, and then click on the various app icons to be\nlogged in automatically via SSO. Clever application partners rely on Clever's verification system of determining that a user is,\nindeed, who they say they are. Without Clever SSO, each application would need to maintain its own database of users and their\ncredentials. \n \n\nThis article details the setup process for using ADFS as your district's Clever SSO method.\n \n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIn addition to the basic single sign-on (SSO) requirements, you’ll need the following:\n \n\n * Active Directory Federation Services 2.x, 3.x or 4.x\n * Metadata file accessible over HTTPS with a certificate signed by a valid certificate authority\n * Make sure the following IP addresses are allow listed in your firewall:\n   * 54.241.134.131\n   * 50.18.217.135\n   * 54.241.154.41\n * At least one real account to use to test the connection: In order to test the connection after set-up, you’ll need the\n   credentials of a student or teacher. You won’t be able to test with other admin credentials; it needs to be someone whose\n   information is also in Clever. If this is problematic, we recommend creating a test teacher or student in your SIS, syncing\n   with Clever, and using that account instead of a real one to test the connection.\n\n \n\n\nTHE USER EXPERIENCE\n\n 1. When you set up Active Directory, you define usernames and passwords for your users.\n 2. When users access the Clever Portal or a single sign-on (SSO) link, they’ll be prompted to log in to Clever using these\n    credentials by clicking 'Log in with Active Directory'\n 3. Once they click this button, they will be redirected to your Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) login page.\n 4. After users successfully log in to your Active Directory server, your ADFS instance will use claims rules to tell us which\n    user is logging in.\n\n \n\nPlease note: Because the credentials are entered only on the Active Directory login page, Clever will never know the usernames and\npasswords for your users.\n\n\n\nCONFIGURING ADFS\n\nYou'll need to configure Active Directory to connect with Clever single sign-on (SSO). You'll need to update two areas:\n\n * Relying Party Trusts\n * Claim Rules\n\n\nRelying Party Trust\n\n 1. In ADFS Management, open Trust Relationships > Relying Party Trusts.\n 2. Click 'Add Relying Party Trusts' and input https://clever.com/oauth/saml/metadata.xml where it asks for Federation Metadata\n    address\n\n\n 3. On the next page, you can leave the default display name (Clever.com) or change it to any display name you choose.\n\n\n 4. On the next page, select 'Permit all users to access this relying party'\n\n\n 5. Review your choices and Finish.\n\n\nClever should now be listed as a Relying Party Trust.\n\n\nClaim Rules\n\nClever.com will now appear in the list of Relying Party Trusts. Right-click the display name and select 'Edit Claims Rules'. These\nrules will ensure that Clever matches students and teachers appropriately when they log in.\n \n\n 1. Select 'Add Rule' - the default on the first page should be 'Send LDAP Attributes as Claims'\n    \n 2. On the next page, you can set the Claim Rule Name to anything you’d like.\n 3. Select Active Directory as the attribute store - there will be two adjacent drop-down menus.\n 4. For the first attribute, select 'SAM-Account-Name' on the left and 'Name ID' on the right.\n    \n 5. Two new drop-downs should appear. Use the new row of drop-downs to define a claims rule - a field in your Clever SIS sync that\n    contains the same unique identifier as a field in Active Directory.\n\n * The left drop-down will contain the attribute you’d like to send\n * The right drop-down will contain the Clever field that we will match that data with. A list of supported entries for 'Outgoing\n   Claim Type', as well as more information on Claims Rules can be found in our article: Understanding Claims Rules.\n\nHere’s an example of fully set up claims rules:\n\n\n\nIn the above sample:\n\n * SAM-Account-Name matches to sis_id for students in Clever\n * E-Mail-Addresses matches to emails for teachers in Clever.\n\n\nThis is what our systems will use to authenticate the user logging in and give them access to the correct applications through\nClever.\n \n\nImportant Note! You will need to personalize the LDAP attribute and Outgoing Claim Type based on the data available in Active\nDirectory and Clever for your district. Regardless of the personalized claims rules for your district, you must have the first\nclaims rule pictured above (SAM-Account-Name -> Name ID).\n\n \n\n6. Select 'Finish' to finalize setup in ADFS! \n\n\n\nCONFIGURING CLEVER SSO WITH ADFS\n\n \n\n 1. Find your Metadata URL - in your ADFS Management Console, browse to Service > Endpoints > Metadata > Type: Federation\n    Metadata. It should take the format: https://<ADFS server name>/federationmetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml\n 2. Make sure your certificates are set up correctly - to do so, put your Metadata URL into SSL Checker. This tool will let you\n    know if there are any issues that might prevent us from accepting your Metadata URL.\n\n\nInputting your Metadata URL\n \n\nTake the following steps in the Clever Admin Dashboard: \n \n\n 1. Under your Clever Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Portal settings page, choose the shortname for your SSO portal URL. The\n    URL will be www.clever.com/in/<shortname>. Remember to use something that your students and teachers will remember easily.\n     \n 2. Under Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO Settings page, click Add Login Method and select Configure SAML Authentication.\n    Input your metadata URL in the text box and select Save.\n    \n    \n     \n    \n     \n 3. To finish the setup process, add the contact details for the person that students and teachers should reach out to if they\n    have trouble with logging in to Clever; this should be someone who can help them reset their Active Directory credentials\n    and/or make sure they are shared with the application they’re trying to access through Clever. Add this at Clever Dashboard >\n    SSO & Portal > SSO settings > Customize.\n\n\nYou should now be set up - try a few logins and see if you run into any issues! If you have questions about this process, please\nsubmit a request.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Clever SSO Policy"

We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen users sign in to their Identity Provider to use single sign-on (SSO), the identity provider sends us a piece of data and\ntells us which field in Clever contains matching data. Using this, we can identify the user and give them access to their\napplications. \n \n\nClaims rules define which attributes are sent to Clever from the identity provider and which fields Clever should use to perform\nthe match. You will need to find a claims rule for each user type (e.g. students, teachers, staff, etc.) that you want to use\nsingle sign-on (SSO).\n \n\nPlease note: Claims rules are only necessary for Active Directory, Lenovo Stoneware / webNetwork, LDAPS, and Office 365 / Entra\nID.\n\n\n\nHOW DO I USE CLAIMS RULES?\n\nPicking the right identity provider attribute\n \n\nFirst, look at the data in your Clever account - you can click on a record in the data browser to view all the information that’s\ncurrently synced in Clever.\n \n\nNext, compare the data in Clever to the data attributed to users in your identity provider (IDP). Are there matches? In order for\nusers to be able to log in, the data in the IDP attribute and the data in the field in Clever must match exactly.\n \n\nAdditionally, make sure you’re picking something that’s unique across all users. If a claims rule matches multiple users, Clever\nwon't know which user to match it against and the login attempt will fail.\n \n\nIf you can find a match, great! That’s the attribute you should use for that user type. If not, you’ll want to sync additional\ndata from your SIS in order to be able to create a match.\n \n\n\nDEFINING THE FIELD IN CLEVER\n\n \n\nOnce you’ve found a match, you’ll want to take note of the field in Clever it matches to. What’s the name of the field in the left\ncolumn of the user's Detail view? Make a note of it!\n\n \n\nPlease note: Extension fields can't be used as an option at this time.\n\n \n\nThe field in Clever is expressed in the claims rule “clever.<user type or any>.<field name>” Here are a few commonly used fields:\n \n\nStudents\n\n * clever.student.email\n * clever.student.sis_id\n * clever.student.student_number\n * clever.student.credentials.district_username\n\nTeachers\n\n * clever.teacher.email\n * clever.teacher.sis_id\n * clever.teacher.teacher_number\n * clever.teacher.credentials.district_username\n\nStaff\n(Previously: School Admins)\n\n * clever.staff.email\n * clever.staff.staff_id\n * clever.staff.credentials.district_username\n * clever.school_admin.email (outdated)\n * clever.school_admin.staff_id (outdated)\n * clever.school_admin.credentials.district_username (outdated)\n\nDistrict Clever Admins\n\n * clever.district_admin.email\n\n \n\nYou’ll notice that users share multiple fields - to match on the same field for multiple user types, you can use ‘any’ in place of\nthe user type to try matching against all user types.\n\n * clever.any.email\n * clever.any.sis_id\n * clever.any.credentials.district_username\n\n\n\nAPPLYING THE CLAIMS RULES TO SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO)\n\nClick the link below to jump to Instant Login setup for your identity provider!\n \n\n * Active Directory\n * Lenovo Stoneware / webNetwork\n * LDAPS\n * Office 365 / Entra ID"

Districts that are using SAML as their\nSingle sign-on (SSO) method provide Clever with secure access to their Active Directory server via an LDAP Bind Account, allowing\ndistrict users to configure their own password reset method (either through email or text message) in Clever.\n \n\n\nDISTRICT SETUP\n\nTo use the Clever Active Directory password reset feature, your district will first need to set up Active Directory as your login\nmethod from your Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings page.\n\n For instructions on how to set up Active Directory as your district’s login method, visit: Single sign-on (SSO): Active Directory\nFederation Services (ADFS).\n\n\nOnce this is established, select the Manage Account Recovery button. This will launch the District AD Account Recovery set-up\nwizard.\n \n\n\n \n\nYou will first need to enter the URL for your district’s LDAP server and the SHA-1 fingerprint.\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: If you do not know what your SHA-1 fingerprint is, you can select 'Download from server,' and Clever will find it for\nyou.\n\n\nNext, configure the LDAP server:\n\n * User attribute to match to the specified Clever field\n   * For the Search Attribute, provide the Active directory field you think would best serve as a field to search on in Active\n     Directory and the Clever field it will match with. This field should be unique across all user types (e.g. students,\n     teachers, school admins, etc.).\n * The base DN\n * The Bind Account username and password\n\nPlease note: The Bind Account will need to have write access, allowing Clever to find student and teacher accounts to reset their\npasswords. \n\n\n\n \n\nLastly, you will be able to set additional configurations, which include:\n\n * Surfacing the search field (user identifier) to users\n * Selecting which user types are allowed to use this feature\n * The AD password requirements\n * Email domains you would like to exclude from being used as recovery methods\n * Whether or not teachers (and School Tech Leads) can reset their students' AD passwords\n\n\n\n\nSelect Finish. Students, teachers, and School Tech Leads can now reset their AD passwords from their Clever portals! \n \n\nFor instructions on how users reset their Active Directory password through Clever, visit: For staff: How do I use Account\nRecovery?"

LDAPS\nis a more secure variant of LDAP that uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to ensure that usernames and passwords are transmitted\nsecurely. For security reasons, Clever does not support using non-secure LDAP with single sign-on (SSO). We are unable to provide\nsupport for upgrading your existing LDAP system to LDAPS at this time, but this guide may be helpful if you are using Active\nDirectory. \n\n\n\nSETUP\n\nHere's what we'll need to get you set up:\n \n\n 1. A hostname or IP address for your LDAP server.\n 2. You'll need to allow Clever external IP addresses (54.241.134.131, 50.18.217.135, 54.241.154.41) access through your firewall.\n 3. Your Base DNs and and username suffix - or a BIND account.\n 4.

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Single sign-on (SSO) with Stoneware\n3. Can I use the Clever Portal instead of the Stoneware Portal?\n4. Setup Preparation\n5. Configuring the Public webApp for Clever\n6. Finishing setup with Clever support\n7. Adding applications to the Stoneware Portal\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever’s single sign-on (SSO) allows students and teachers to safely access education apps with a single username and password.\nYou can rely on your existing user management system - single sign-on (SSO) supports common user management systems like Lenovo\nStoneware.\n \n\nTo use single sign-on (SSO) with Stoneware, you’ll need the following:\n\n * Active SIS sync with Clever\n * webNetwork version 6.3.0.167 and above\n\n\nBefore you start setting up single sign-on (SSO) with Stoneware, it’s important to look at the attributes in Stoneware and the\ndata that’s synced to Clever - in order for users to be able to authenticate, there needs to be an attribute in Stoneware that\nmatches the user’s sis_id. Additionally, we recommend having your users’ mail attribute match the email address in Clever, though\nthis is not mandatory. \n\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) WITH STONEWARE\n\n \n 1. When you set up Stoneware, you define usernames and passwords for your users.\n 2. When you set up single sign-on (SSO) with Stoneware, you create a hidden SAML application on your Stoneware portal, so when\n    students authenticate to Stoneware, they are logged in to the hidden SAML application.\n 3. When users click on an single sign-on (SSO) link, Clever queries the SAML application to see which user is logged in. The SAML\n    application uses claims rules to identify the user, and we grant them access to the application if they are correctly set up\n    in Clever and in Stoneware.\n\n\nPlease note: Because credentials are only entered on the Stoneware Portal log in screen, Clever will never know the usernames and\npasswords of your users.\n \n\n\nCAN I USE THE CLEVER PORTAL INSTEAD OF THE STONEWARE PORTAL?\n\nIt’s possible to log in to the Clever Portal using your Stoneware credentials once single sign-on (SSO) with Stoneware is set up.\nHowever, as the Stoneware set up process requires adding single sign-on (SSO) links to the Stoneware Portal in order for users to\nbe able to log in, districts generally prefer to use the existing Stoneware Portal.\n \n\n\nSETUP PREPARATION\n\nIf you haven't finished signing up for a Clever account yet, you can choose \"Custom Username & Password\" and \"Synced Passwords\" to\nstart. Once you have access to the Clever Admin Dashboard, take the following steps:\n \n\n 1. Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Portal settings page.\n 2. Choose the shortname for your ingle sign-on (SSO) portal URL. The URL will be www.clever.com/shortname. Remember to use\n    something that your students and teachers will remember easily.\n 3. Keep Identity System set to \"Google Apps\" or \"Clever Passwords\" for now\n 4. Add the contact information that students and teachers should reach out to if they have trouble with logging in to Clever -\n    this should be someone who can help them reset their Stoneware credentials and/or make sure they are shared with the\n    application they're trying to access through Clever.\n 5. Click Save.\n\n\n\nCONFIGURING THE PUBLIC WEBAPP FOR CLEVER\n\nYou’ll need to configure Stoneware to connect with Clever single sign-on (SSO). In order to do so, you’ll need to set up a public\nwebApp for Clever.\n \n\nCreating a Public webApp\n \n\n 1. Open webAdmin, right-click \"Applications Admin\", \"Create Public Application\", and enter \"Clever SSO\" as the webApp name.\n 2. Open the Clever SSO \"Properties\" tab and set the following properties:\n    \n    1. Description: “CleverSSO”\n    2. Application Type: “Public”\n    3. Context Path (Alias) “/CleverSSO”\n       1. You may need to refresh the page for this option to appear\n    4. Assigned Relay(s): This should assign the app to each relay in your environment by default. //More complex setup? Reach out\n       to StonewareUse the green ‘+’ icon to assign the app to each relay in your environment\n    5. Please note that Assigned Link should be blank\n\n\nSetting up Single-Sign-On to the Clever webApp\nOpen the Clever SSO ‘Authentication Tab and set the following properties:\n \n\n\n \n\n * Type: ADFS\n * Identity: Use the Wizard to add an attribute that matches data in Clever\n * SAML Initiation: Service Provider\n * Assertion Consumer: https://clever.com/oauth/saml/\n * PFX Certificate: Click on the Wizard button\n   \n   * Set Algorithm to RSA and Strength to 2048\n   * Click the “Generate” button, then the “Overwrite” button\n * Certificate: Use the wizard to configure the certificate as you would any other self-signed certificate.\n * SAML Logout Behavior: Full Logout\n\n\nSetting up Attributes for single sign-on (SSO)\n\nOpen the CleverSSO “Attributes” or “Provisioning” tab and set the following properties:\n\n\n \n\n * Attribute Assertion: Enabled\n * Type: SAML\n * Attribute Assertion Parameters: Use the green ‘+’ button to add the following attributes:\n   * clever.any.sis_id = <the Stoneware Attribute that matches Clever sis_id>\n   * clever.any.email = @@attr:mail@@\n     * This attribute is optional but recommended!\n\n\nOnce you’re done here, hit save and reload the page!\n\n\nTesting the Public webApp\nNavigate to https:// <dns of your webNetwork system>/swPublicSSO/SAMLMetadata/CleverSSO - this should display a page like this:\n \n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to double-check that the two attributes at the bottom match the attributes you set up in the CleverSSO webApp.\n \n\nIf this page does not load or does not properly display the attributes, double-check your webApp configuration and assignments,\nand try reloading this page.\n\n\n\nFINISHING SETUP WITH CLEVER SUPPORT\n\nOnce you’ve finished the above, please contact Clever Support and provide the following information:\n \n\n * The URL that you used to test your CleverSSO webApp\n * An application that you’ve added to your Portal\n\n\nWe’ll help you finalize setup and test your first logins!\n\n\n\nADDING APPLICATIONS TO THE STONEWARE PORTAL\n\nYou can add Clever apps to the Stoneware Portal using single sign-on (SSO) links - this allows users to access applications\nseamlessly, thanks to the public webApp you’ve set up. Once you’ve acquired the direct link from your Clever dashboard, you can\nadd it to the portal by adding a new Link Object to your portal for each application and assigning it to the appropriate users.\n \n\nThe Link Object should look like this:\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: single sign-on (SSO) will only work for users who both have access to this Link Object and are shared with the\napplication in question through Clever.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about setting up Clever SSO, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help!"

We offer support for Active Directory Federation Services  (AD and Entra\nID), Okta, and Rapid ID. However, any SAML connection can be created by following the same steps outlined in this article. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nHere's what your Identity Provider (IDP) must have: \n \n\n 1.  Support for SP-initiated sign on using a Redirect Binding\n 2.  Response must be sent to a specified POST Binding (https://clever.com/oauth/saml/assert)\n 3.  Response must contain an assertion encrypted using Clever's public key (found in the metadata file)\n 4.  The assertion must be signed with a private key owned by the IDP\n 5.  The assertion must contain an AuthnStatement with a SessionIndex\n 6.  The assertion must contain at least one attribute which can uniquely identify a Clever user\n 7.  Multiple attributes are allowed and only one needs to match a user, but only one user must be matched.\n 8.  Attributes should be in the form clever.[user type].[field] and contain the field they wish to match on.\n     * For example, an attribute with the name clever.student.sis_id with a value of 12345 will attempt to find a student with the\n       SIS ID of 12345. A user type of 'any' may be used to match both students and teachers with the same field. \n 9.  A LogoutRequest must be accepted at a Redirect Binding. The LogoutResponse should be sent to the specified HTTP-Redirect\n     Binding (https://clever.com/oauth/saml/assert)\n 10. There cannot be a trailing whitespace or a newline at the start and end of the certificate.\n\n \n\nPlease note: Clever doesn't have insight into the configurations or set-up steps that allow your IDP to meet the above\nrequirements for custom SAML connections. You can find more information here: Single Sign-On (SSO): Identity Provider (IDP)/Login\nMethod Options\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nOnce you have verified the above requirements and have either the URL or .xml file, you can navigate to Clever Dashboard > SSO &\nPortal > SSO Settings page in your district dashboard. \n\n\n\n 1. Click Add Login Method in the top right corner, then select SAML Authentication. This will allow for a SAML connection to\n    Clever.\n\n\n\n \n\n 2. Input your metadata URL in the text box. \n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Select your Identity Provider from the dropdown. If your Identity Provider is not available, select SAML IdP.\n\n \n\n\n\n 4. Select Save.\n 5. To finish the setup process:\n\n 1. 1. Go to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > SSO settings > Customize and customize your login screen by clicking on the gray\n       pencil icons.\n    2. Add the Tech Support Contact details for the person that students and teachers should reach out to if they have trouble\n       logging in to Clever; this should be someone who can help them reset their credentials and/or make sure they are shared\n       with the application they’re trying to access through Clever.\n    3. Add any login hints for your login methods (e.g., if you’re using one login method for students and one for teachers).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nYou should now be set up! Try a few logins and see if you run into any issues. If you have questions about this process, please\ncontact our support team."

FAQ\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article has troubleshooting tips for common Chromebooks setup issues and provides Clever Admins with a brief overview of how\nClever can be used to simplify Google Chromebook logins for your end users. There are two methods for using Clever with Google\nChromebooks: \n \n\n1) Users use Clever Badges to log into Chromebooks, then access Clever.\n \n\n * Students open their Chromebooks and scan their Clever Badge.\n * This automatically logs the students into their Chromebooks and Clever Portals (they do not need to log in again).\n * Students can click on any learning application to begin their learning session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Users log into Chromebooks manually, using credentials, and then access Clever.\n\n * Students open Chromebooks and log in with their district-provided Google login credentials.\n * After logging in, the district’s Clever Portal is automatically opened for them (i.e., students do not need to log in again).  \n * Students can click on any application icon to begin their learning session.\n\nDepending on your preferences, each method can be configured separately for different Organizational Units (OUs) in your Google\nAdmin Console.\n\n \n\nFor either of the login flows above, Clever can be configured as either an organization-wide identity provider (IdP) for Google or\nan SSO Profile. For instructions on setting up Clever as an organization-wide IdP, please see this article. Please see this\narticle for instructions on setting up Clever as an SSO Profile in Google.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING CLEVER BADGE SETUP\n\nBelow are some troubleshooting tips we put together in case you see unexpected issues logging into Chromebooks with Clever Badges.\n \n\n\nTEST CHROMEBOOK LOGINS WITH CLEVER BADGES\n\n 1. Create a test Organizational Unit (OU) and apply the Clever Badges settings to the OU.\n 2. Choose a student to test and generate a Clever Badge for them. Note, this must be a real student unless you have a test user\n    with a Google account syncing with Clever.\n 3. Move that student to the test OU.\n 4. Move the Chromebook you’re using to the test OU.\n 5. Log into the Chromebook using the student’s Clever Badge.\n\n \n\n\nCHECK YOUR SETUP\n\n * Require a change of password on the next sign in\n   Users are unable to log in using SSO when the reset password on first login functionality in the Admin Console is active. Make\n   sure you're not using this functionality for any users accessing Google using SSO, including a Clever Badge login to a\n   Chromebook. This is a limitation of Google SSO Using 3rd Party IdPs. For more details on this topic see this article from\n   Google.\n * Generate Clever Badges. Make sure you’ve generated Clever Badges for your users. You can find instructions for generating\n   Clever Badges here.\n\n \n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING TIPS\n \n\nIf Chromebooks do not prompt users to log in with Clever Badges:\n\n * Check the OU settings for your devices. The Chromebooks you want to set up to use Clever Badge logins should be in an OU with\n   the Clever Badges settings applied.\n * Check your device settings. Kiosk mode and public sessions should be turned off for the Chromebooks you want to use with Clever\n   Badges.\n * Check your version of Chrome. You should be using Chrome OS version M52 or later.\n\nIf an error message appears after the Clever Badge is scanned:\n\n * Check the Chromebook OU settings for your students. Students who log in with Clever Badges should be in an OU with the Clever\n   Badges settings applied. If students are not in the correct OU, their badges cannot authenticate into Chromebooks.\n * Validate the Clever Badge is working. Test the Clever Badge by using it to log in at https://clever.com/in/badges. If that\n   login isn’t working, the badge is likely invalidated. You may have to generate a new Clever Badge for the student.\n * Check your Clever sync for Google email addresses. Students using Clever Badges to log into Chromebooks should have Google\n   email addresses synced to your Clever account. Clever uses this information to match users with their Google accounts. You can\n   always check your synced data via the Clever Dashboard > Data Browser.\n * Confirm if Google is allowed in your network filters, including http://accounts.google.com/signup/oauth.\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR REMOTE LEARNING\n\nWhen we initially recommended settings for the Clever Badges into Chromebooks integration, we anticipated this feature to be used\nprimarily in a classroom setting with shared devices. As such, we recommended settings that would ensure students would not\naccidentally access another student's account throughout the day while sharing devices.\n\nSpecifically, we recommended that districts configure their Idle Settings so that if a student closed their Chromebook lid or the\ndevice idled, they would be logged out of the device and need to re-authenticate into the Chromebook.\n\nFor most schools, these settings have worked great! However, in the remote context, students’ needs have changed. Many students\nare no longer sharing Chromebooks, and are using their devices continually throughout the day. As such, we have updated our\nrecommended settings for districts that are 1:1.\n\nRecommended Solution\n\nYou can allow students to stay logged into their Chromebooks by updating the device settings to the following in the Google Admin\nConsole: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these settings applied, students can open and close the lid of their Chromebook without being logged out of the device. To\nlog out of the device, the student will: \n\n 1. At the bottom right, select the time.\n 2. Click Sign out.\n\nDepending on your district’s security preferences, you can independently choose to set either of these settings to Sleep\nor Logout. It is not required to change both settings. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\"Erase all local user data\" - Is this setting required or recommended?\n\n * \"Erase all local user data\" is not required or recommended for the Clever Badges into Chromebooks integration for most\n   deployments, as it can cause issues with available device storage space.\n    \n\nCan Clever Badges be used to log into Chromebooks without an internet connection (offline)?\n\n * No. To facilitate logins, Chromebooks must be connected to the internet so Clever’s system can authenticate them. A user may\n   elect to change the settings for their device to ensure a device is not locked upon idle or lid close. As long as the user does\n   not power off the device or manually log out, their active session will be preserved.\n    \n\nDo we need to require forced logout upon idle or lid close?\n\n * No. These settings are recommended if devices are being shared by multiple users. If your district is 1:1, you can change these\n   idle settings to Sleep. For more information on this topic, click here.\n\n\nStudents receive the following error when logging in: Uh oh! Assertion must contain at least one subject or attribute list\n\n * This error means that the student does not have an email address synced to Clever. To resolve the issue, please confirm their\n   email is populated in your SIS and synced to Clever. \n\n\nStudents receive the following error when logging in: Sorry! This user does not have a Google email address associated with their\nClever account. Please populate their email address and try again!\n\n * This error means that the student does not have an email address synced to Clever. To resolve the issue, please confirm their\n   email is populated in your SIS and synced to Clever. \n\n  \n\n\nWant to truly become a Clever Champion? Get certified in the Clever Academy"

This article runs through how\nto add the app and how it works for students and teachers.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nHOW DO I ADD THE CLEVER IOS APP?\n\nThe application is available for free via the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Clever iOS app requires iOS 9.0 or later and is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. If you are using a device that\nis running iOS 11 or later, you will need to update to the newest version of the Clever app.\n\nTo deploy the Clever iOS app across all the devices in your district, please follow Apple’s instructions for mobile device\nmanagement.\n\nPlease note: Some applications don't provide mobile support, which means that you may not be able to access them via your phone or\ntablet. If you're unsure, please reach out to the application to confirm.\n\n \nThe Clever iOS app will use the default browser for your device. Please ensure that either Safari or Google Chrome is the default\nbrowser for any device used with the Clever iOS app. For Safari, you can adjust this by navigating to Settings > Browser >\nSafari. \n\nSafari can not be disabled. It doesn't need to be the the default browser, but if disabled, the Clever app won't work.\n\nTo set Google Chrome as the default browser for your iOS device, navigate to Settings > Chrome and set the Default Browser App to\nChrome. Directions from Apple can be found here.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nEXPECTED LOGIN BEHAVIOR\n\n\nStudents logging in with Badges\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. The first step is for students to download the Clever iOS app from the Apple App Store if you haven't deployed it at the\n    district level.\n 2. They will then click on the Clever app to open it.\n 3. The first screen students will see is the Clever badge camera.\n 4. In the top right corner, students have the ability to toggle between the front-facing and back-facing cameras.\n 5. Once the badge camera appears, students will need to hold their badge up to the camera on the mobile device.\n 6. If the student is using a valid badge, they will see a green checkmark with sparkles signifying a successful login! \n\n * If the student sees a red X, they may need to reach out to their teacher or a district admin for assistance.\n\n 7. The Clever app will then open in the Safari browser where students can access all of their learning applications.\n\n           \n\n \n\nLogging in with credentials\n\n 1. When opening the Clever app, users will see the Badge Camera.\n\n 2. They will select the Log in with username/password option at the bottom of the screen which will open a new Clever tab in a\n    Safari browser.\n 3. The user will locate their school from the Clever login page.\n 4. They will then be led to their district's login page where they can select the appropriate login method (e.g. Log in with\n    Google, Log in with Clever, etc.) and enter their credentials. For more information on this, please visit: \n\n * For Families: How do I help my student log into Clever?\n * For Teachers: How do I log into the Clever Portal?\n\n \n\nPlease note: The Clever app will remember the user's district after their first login on the device, so this user will not need to\ngo through the process of selecting their school again if the Safari browser and/or Clever app were never fully closed, and device\nhistory has not been deleted.\n\n             \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN A USER SELECTS A LEARNING APPLICATION?\n\nAfter users sign into the Clever SSO app the Clever Portal will open in the device's default browser. Once they select an\napplication, they'll be automatically authenticated into that learning application's website in a new browser tab.\n\nSome applications will automatically redirect users from the Clever Portal to their standalone iOS application. This functionality\nis determined by application partners on a per-app basis.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR USING MULTIPLE APPS IN ONE SESSION\n\nWe aim to connect students, teachers, and staff to as many of their resources as possible. After a user is logged in to Clever:\n \n\n 1. They can click on one of their connected applications.\n 2. This will open the application or external link within the original tab.\n 3. If a user wants to go back to the previous tab, they should use the Safari back button. They will still be signed into their\n    Clever portal when they go back, and can then access their other applications from there.  \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR LOGGING OUT OF CLEVER\n\nWhether using a shared device or not, the best practice is to always log out of your district's Identity Provider (IDP) in\naddition to Clever when you are finished. To do this, follow these steps:\n \n\nStep 1: Log out of Clever\n\n * From the Clever Portal, click on your name in the top right corner, and select Log out.\n\n\nStep 2: Log out of your district's Identity Provider (IDP)\n\n * For example: Google, Active Directory, LDAP, Canvas, Clever Passwords\n\n \n\n For information regarding best practices on shared devices, please see this Help Center article: For Families: Logging your\nstudents out of Clever on a shared device\n\n\nAdditional resources regarding the Clever iOS app:\n \n\n * For Families: Troubleshooting issues with the Clever iOS app\n * For Teachers: How do I troubleshoot using the Clever iOS app?\n\n\nIf you have any additional questions, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help!"

This article provides general information on how to use Login Logs to investigate problems logging in to Clever.\n\nFor a detailed, daily summary of usage for students, teachers, and staff in your district, including those that may be inactive,\nplease enable Participation Reports.\n\nIn addition, review these Help Center articles for more troubleshooting steps for your specific Identity Provider (IDP).\n\n * Active Directory/ADFS\n * Canvas\n * Clever Badges\n * Clever Passwords\n * Google\n * LDAPS\n * Office 365/Entra ID\n * Lenovo Stoneware/webNetwork\n * Visit this article for information on the various IDPs supported by Clever.\n\n \n\nPlease note: This article is to troubleshoot logins to Clever, not logins to applications. For application login issues, please\nvisit: Troubleshooting: Logging in to applications\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nVIEWING YOUR DISTRICT OR SCHOOLS LOGIN LOGS\n\nThe best place to start when troubleshooting an error logging into Clever is your Login Logs (Support tools > Login logs). This\ntool provides you with the information you need to find out why a user's login was unsuccessful. \n\n\n\nLogin logs provide data for the past 14 days of login events to Clever. You can filter by login success, user type, and search by\nClever ID or Reference ID. Reference IDs are provided if the login to the IdP was successful but the user was not authenticated\ninto Clever. Reference IDs are super helpful if you need to reach out to Clever support.\n\n\nIf you prefer, you can export the data as a CSV for local use. \n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: Login logs are able to show District Admin logins, including if they used MFA and which MFA method they used.\nHowever, they will not show failed login/password attempts (i.e. if a DA enters the wrong password there will not be a log in the\ncorresponding login logs), but the logs will show failed MFA attempts.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING LOGIN ERRORS\n\nIt's important to recognize where the source of the error lies in order to troubleshoot effectively! For example, getting an\ninvalid username or password error message for a Clever Passwords login may be something that needs to be corrected within your\nstudent information system (SIS), while a match failure for an ADFS login may be an issue with your claims rules. \n\n\nSelect the View Details link next to the individual failed login attempt in your Login Logs to obtain information on what went\nwrong during the login process. Then, select Learn more about this error to troubleshoot the issue further. \n \n\nAdditionally, most Clever login errors come with a reference code that you can use to filter user login data in the Login Logs.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nSimply copy the reference code and paste it under Search for User or Reference ID to locate that specific error.\n\n \n \n\n\nSelect view details see additional information.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe most common reasons a user may be unable to log in:\n\n \n\nLogin Logs result\n\nError explained\n\nSolution\n\n  When you see more than one Clever ID listed as a match, this means there are multiple accounts with the same email\naddress/username. Clever is unable to log the user in since we don't know which account they are logging in to. \n 1. Enter the user's email address/username in the search bar in the Clever Dashboard. \n 2. The accounts with the blue boxes around them indicate they are an exact match for the email/username searched.\n 3. Determine if the user has a duplicate account or if one of the accounts has an incorrect email/username.\n 4. If it is a duplicate account, remove the second account from the data syncing from your SIS.\n\nIf the email address/username for one of the accounts is incorrect, update the email address/username in the data syncing from\nyour SIS.\n\n  \n\nIf it shows that there are no Clever IDs found, this means there email/username is incorrect or missing in Clever.\n\n 1. Look up the user that is having issues logging in. \n 2. Locate their email/username in Clever (this depends on your login method configuration).\n    * Google - email\n    * Clever Passwords: username depends on the field configured for the username here\n    * EntraID or any other IdP: username depends on the attributes configured within your IdP\n 3. Check the following:\n    * Is the user's email or the field used for their username populated?\n    * Does the email or field used for their username correct? Sometimes, a character is missing, or an extra character is added.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nWHAT IF I DON'T SEE MY ERROR HERE?\n\nIf you’re seeing an error that isn’t covered in this Help Center article, please do the following:\n \n\n 1. Review these Help Center articles for additional troubleshooting steps for your specific IDP.\n    1. Active Directory/ADFS\n    2. Canvas\n    3. Clever Badges\n    4. Clever Passwords\n    5. Google\n    6. LDAPS\n    7. Office 365/Entra ID\n    8. Lenovo Stoneware/webNetwork\n 2. If you still have issues, document the specifics of what is occurring when the user attempts to log in to Clever (e.g., error\n    message, reference code, screenshot, etc.). \n 3. Contact Clever Support with the details so we can help you resolve the issue!"

Resetting passwords\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn addition to other Clever-supported Identity Providers (IdPs) like Google and Active Directory, districts can also choose to\nutilize Clever Passwords for Clever single sign-on (SSO). With Clever Passwords, district admins determine which login credentials\nshould be used for students, teachers, and staff. These credentials are configured from the SSO Settings page within the Clever\nDashboard.\n\nWhen district users navigate to your district's Clever Portal URL, they will enter their username and password. In cases where a\ndistrict uses multiple IdPs, users will select Log in with Clever to enter their credentials.  \n\nOccasionally, users will have issues logging in, and troubleshooting is required by a district admin. This article details the\nrecommended steps for troubleshooting and resolving Clever Passwords user login issues.\n \n\nFor information about single sign-on (SSO) with Clever Passwords, including how to set it up, please read this article. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST\n\n * The user must have an active Clever account.\n * The fields the district is using for username and password for Clever Passwords must be populated for the student, teacher, or\n   staff. Review the current fields being used on the SSO settings page.\n * Confirm if the values in the above fields are unique for each user. The username must be unique.\n * Try resetting their password using the directions found here.\n * If resetting the password does not work, it is possible credentials need to be re-synced. To re-sync credentials, follow the\n   directions found here. \n * If a user is excluded from using Clever Passwords via SSO Policy, they'll see a \"sso_policy_exclusion error\" if they try to log\n   in, which indicates that the user entered the correct Clever Password username and password combination to log in, but the user\n   isn't allowed to use Clever Passwords to login. This will also show up in login logs, which are explained below. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGIN LOGS\n\nThe best place to start when troubleshooting an error logging into Clever are your Login Logs.  This tool provides you with the\ninformation needed to identify why a user's login was unsuccessful. For more information on how to use Login Logs, please see\nTroubleshooting Tools - Login Logs.\n\nLogin Logs provide data for the past 14 days. You can filter by login success, user type, and search by Clever ID or Reference ID.\nThink of a Reference ID as an error code. \n\nIf you prefer, you can export the data as a CSV for local use. \n\n\n\n \n\nSuccessful login attempts will show by the user's unique identifier along with the login method that was used. \n\nFailed logins should produce a 16-digit alpha-numeric Reference ID. Use the Reference ID to find more information about the login\nattempt and its cause in Login Logs. Select view details see additional information\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRESETTING PASSWORDS\n\nIt is important to note that after the initial setup of Clever Passwords for your district, user passwords will not be dynamically\nupdated as new or updated data is synced to Clever from your SIS.\n\n * For example, If your district has set up student passwords to be their birthdates, and then you update a student's birthdate in\n   your SIS, their password will not automatically be updated in Clever to reflect the new birthdate. \n\nTo resolve this, it is sometimes necessary to manually update a student or teacher's password in Clever or run a password reset\nfor all students, teachers, or staff. \n\nDepending on your current SSO settings for each user type, the password reset option might be available for some users to reset\ntheir own passwords or for teachers to reset student passwords. Users who reset their own passwords must have an email address in\nClever for the password reset to work. \n\n\n\n\nRESET PASSWORD (DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHER/STUDENT)\n\n 1. From the district's login page, select Get help logging in!\n 2. Select Reset your password and enter your school-provided email address\n 3. An email will be sent with a link to reset your password\n\nPlease note: If your district has enabled this feature, teachers can reset student passwords by following the instructions in this\narticle: For Teachers: Troubleshooting student login issues\n\n \n\n\nRESET PASSWORD (DIRECTIONS FOR CLEVER ADMIN)\n\nTO RESET INDIVIDUAL USER PASSWORDS:\n\nClever Admins can manually reset passwords for individual students, teachers, and staff members.\n 1. Use the search bar at the top of the Clever Dashboard to search for and view the student or teacher's profile\n 2. In the top right, click Support tools > Set new Clever password\n\n\n \n 3. Enter a new password and then confirm that password\n 4. If you wish to require users to change their password upon their next login, check off the box to do so\n 5. Click Save\n\n\nTO RESET ALL CREDENTIALS BACK TO THE DEFAULT SETTING BY USER TYPE (STUDENT, TEACHER, OR STAFF):\n\n 1. Navigate to your SSO & Portal > SSO settings page\n 2. Select the Edit settings option for Clever Passwords\n 3. If you would like to reset all student passwords, check the box Reset all credentials. If you do not want student passwords\n    updated, leave the box unchecked\n 4. Select Next  \n 5. You can also choose to reset teacher and staff credentials in steps 3 and 4 if desired\n 6. Select Next until you get to the option to Save\n 7. Please allow up to 15 minutes for Clever to reset all passwords. Once complete, users will be able to log in with their\n    default credentials."

Common errors\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis guide if for district admins familiar with Google SSO through Clever. Use this information to troubleshoot login issues. If\nyou're just getting started with Google and Clever, take a look at the article on Single Sign on (SSO) with Google.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST\n\nDoes the user have an active Clever account?Is the email field populated in Clever for the user?Is the email address in Clever\ncorrect? (up-to-date and no typos)Are there any other users in Clever with the same email address? Their email address must be\nunique.Is the user entering the correct email address? i.e. their school-provided email address, not their personal email address\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGOOGLE LOGIN FLOW\n\nWhen a user clicks 'Log in with Google' from your district's Clever login Portal URL, Clever sends the user to Google where they\nwill enter their district-provided Google email address and password.\n\nClever does not have access to Google passwords for users; however, once the user has entered their credentials, Google will\nredirect the user back to Clever providing a \"token\" that tells Clever this user has successfully logged in. \n\nIf it is the users first time logging into Clever via Google, the user may be prompted to approve Clever as a Google SSO\napplication. \n\nOnce the user is logged in, Clever shares the user's token with any associated applications they attempt to log into. This allows\nthe user to access their Clever apps via single sign-on (SSO) through Clever without needing to enter their credentials again. \n\nPlease note: When a Clever admin accesses the Portal as a user, they are not actually logged into Clever via Google.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLOGIN LOGS\n\nThere are occasional login issues that come up with district users. The first step in investigating a user login issue is to\nnavigate to your Clever Dashboard > Support tools > Login logs. See this article for details on how to filter data from your\ndistrict's Login Logs!\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON ERRORS\n\nHere are the most common errors, and how to resolve them:\n\n * no_match: \n\n * The unique identifier passed to us from the Google did not match any user in Clever. In essence, a user (let's call her\n   \"Susan\") was successfully able to prove who she was to Google, but when Google came to tell Clever \"Hey, can you log Susan in\n   for me?\", we responded \"Sorry, we don't have a Susan here\". The most common cause of this is a user trying to log in that is\n   not yet synced to Clever, but it could also be that the field we match on, say student number or email address, is missing in\n   the SIS upload for the user in question. We show the matches we tried to make in your Single sign-on (SSO) Event Logs, so check\n   there and then look up the corresponding information in your SIS and/or Clever data browser to see what might be going on.\n\n * no_code:\n\n * When a user logs in to Clever for the first time using Google, they are asked to give permission. If they deny permission, we\n   don't get a valid code to log them in with, and show this error. Ask the user to try again, and accept the permissions to use\n   Clever.\n\n * no_token:\n\n * A fairly rare error, this indicates Google had an issue while we were attempting to log the user in. This can indicate that\n   Google had a temporary network glitch, or that there is a bug. If you are seeing this error occur frequently, please reach out\n   as soon as possible to Clever Support so we can work with Google and help you troubleshoot.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to Clever support!

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Troubleshooting\n\nPlease note: Microsoft has changed the name of Azure to Entra ID. We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis guide is meant for people familiar with SAML and Active Directory who are trying to troubleshoot issues their users are\nseeing while using single sign-on (SSO). If you're just getting started with ADFS and Clever, we suggest accessing the article on\nSetting up single sign-on (SSO) with ADFS. To identify issues in your single sign-on (SSO) Setup, view your Clever Dashboard >\nSupport tools > Login logs.\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nNormally, when a user selects 'Login with ADFS', Clever will send the user out to your AD or another SAML server where they will\nenter their username and password. Clever never sees this username and password, but your server will redirect the user back to\nClever with a token confirming the user logged in successfully. Clever will then \"match\" the user in your AD or another SAML\nsystem with a user in Clever, and log them into their app.\n \n\nOccasionally errors do occur. Here are the common errors that we identify, and how to resolve them:\n \n\n * no_match: \n   * The unique identifier passed to Clever by the SAML server did not match any user in Clever. In essence, a user (let's call\n     her \"Susan\") was successfully able to prove who she was to the district's identity provider (IdP), but when the IdP spoke to\n     Clever and said, \"Hey, can you log Susan in for me?\", Clever responded, \"Sorry, we don't have a Susan here.\" The most common\n     cause of this is a user trying to log in that is not yet synced to Clever, but it could also be that the field we match on,\n     say student number or email address, is missing in the SIS upload for the user in question. We show the matches we tried to\n     make in your Clever Dashboard > Support tools > Login logs, so please check there first and then look up the corresponding\n     information in your student information system (SIS) or Clever Data browser to see if you can determine the issue.  \n\n \n\n * no_attributes: \n   * This is similar to no_match in that we couldn't find the user that tried to log in. In contrast to no_match though,\n     no_attributes means that we didn't get any value that we could match on. For instance, say you are matching on email. If your\n     server sent us \"sue.smith@espid.edu\" and we couldn't find that user, Clever would return a no_match error. If your server\n     didn't send us any attributes at all, or if Sue didn't have an email on the SAML server, then we didn't receive any data to\n     match on, and we'll throw a no_attributes. Check in the SAML server to see that the impacted user has all the right\n     attributes, and also take a look at your claims rules to make sure all your claims rules are set up and mapped to valid\n     attributes on your server.  \n\n \n\n * no_session_index:\n   * A somewhat misleading error message, but easy to solve. While technically correct, what this error really means is that\n     you should check your claims rules and ensure that the \"Name ID\" attribute is set, as indicated in the Help Center docs.  \n\n \n\n * no_encrypted_assertion:\n   * This error indicates there is something wrong with how Clever and your SAML server talk securely. This may be an issue with\n     the certificate on your server. We recommend verifying your SSL certification installation using this tool.  \n   * If using Office365 or another SAML connection, under SSO Settings > Login Method > Active Directory Authentication > Edit\n     Settings, please try checking the box to Allow unencrypted SAML assertions (recommended with Entra ID) and test another\n     login. \n\n \n\n * signature_check_failed:\n   * This error indicates the certificate stored in Clever does not match. We recommend uploading a new metadata.xml file in your\n     SSO settings.\n   * To resolve these errors automatically in the future, you can use a metadata URL rather than a manually uploaded file.\n\n \n\n * status_not_success:\n   * A fairly rare error, this indicates that the status code we received back from your AD or SAML server was not a\n     success status code. Often this is a rate-limiting issue, but it can also indicate your server is misconfigured, the network\n     is down, or another server bug. We recommend checking that your AD or SAML server is operational and responding to\n     authentication requests.  \n\n \n\n * unknown: \n   * This is an error that is unknown to Clever. Please reach out to Clever Support."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Best practices for logging out of Clever and connected apps\n3. Logging out of Clever on any device\n4. Logging out of Clever and applications on iOS\n5. Shared devices notifications\n6. Time-out and inactivity\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen logging out, it's important to remember that single sign-on (SSO) can actually be broken down to up to 3 (three) separate\nlogin processes behind the scenes:\n \n\n 1. Identity provider login (e.g. Google)\n 2. Clever login\n 3. Application login (e.g. Khan Academy)\n\n\nIf a student is accessing a shared device, we recommend that they log out of each application and device after their session.\nTherefore users should log out of the application, the Clever portal, and the identity provider (Google, ADFS, etc.) per the steps\nbelow:\n \n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR LOGGING OUT OF CLEVER AND CONNECTED APPS\n\nTo ensure that a user's user session is ended before logging another user in, please follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Log the user out of any learning applications\n\n\nStep 2: Log the user out of Clever\n \n\n * From the Clever Portal, click on the user's name in top right corner, select Log out\n\n\nStep 3: Log out of Google (if applicable) or the district's Identity Provider\n\n\nStep 4: Log in to Clever as new user\n \n\n * Navigate to https://clever.com/login and search for the new user's school. Once the school is located, they will log in with\n   their Badge or credentials. They should now be successfully logged in to their account!\n\n\n\nLOGGING OUT OF CLEVER ON ANY DEVICE\n\nUsers can log out of the Clever portal by navigating to the top right corner of their portal (where they can find their name), and\nthen selecting 'Log Out':\n \n\n \n \n\nPlease note: If your district is using Google as your identity provider (IDP), you can apply a setting from your Clever district\ndashboard > Portal > SSO Settings page that will automatically log users out of Google when they log out of Clever. This is\nhelpful in situations where multiple users are logging into Clever on a shared device.  For more information, visit: Single\nSign-On (SSO): Google \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGGING OUT OF CLEVER AND APPLICATIONS ON IOS\n\nOn an iOS device, double-click the home button (on newer iPad Pros, swipe up from the bottom of the display) to expose the\napplication thumbnails. Swipe up on the Clever app and any learning apps that were launched. This will end a user's session when\nthe device is shared. \n \n\n\n\n\nSHARED DEVICES NOTIFICATIONS\n\nOn certain devices, upon initial sign in to Clever, users will be asked whether or not they should be remembered on the device. If\nthey select 'No, only I use it', then their Clever session will remain intact for 2 hours. \n \n\n\n\n\nIf the user selects 'Yes', Clever will treat the device as a shared device. In this case, users will be prompted with an option to\nsign in as a different user after 10 minutes of inactivity on the Clever portal.\n \n\nClever Tip: This feature gives users who share devices the option to log in to another account, in case the best log-out practices\nwere not followed!  \n\n\n\n\n\nTIME-OUT AND INACTIVITY\n\n\nLOGGING OUT\n\n \n\nUsers are logged out of Clever automatically if: \n \n\n * If a user is inactive in Clever for 24 hours, they will automatically be logged out. Currently, there is no way to customize\n   this behavior.\n    \n * The browser is quit (e.g. \"Quit Google Chrome\").\n   Closing the browser window will not log the user out of Clever. \n    \n\n\n\n If you have any questions, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help!"

What if my desired application isn’t listed?\n5. What's my application's status?\n6. Removing an application\n\n\n \n\n\nGetting started with adding applications? Check out our guide, Onboarding - Adding Applications to Clever, available in Clever\nAcademy!\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever single sign-on (SSO) enables users to be securely authenticated into connected applications via their individual Clever\nPortals. This article explains how district admins can add or remove an online learning application to their district's Clever\nPortal in order to share the app with district users. To learn about the different types of Clever applications, please visit this\narticle.\n \n\n  For specific details about each of the Clever-integrated SSO, Rostering or Library applications, visit our application gallery\nhere.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDING AN APPLICATION\n\n * Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add Applications page.\n\n\n\nThe application search bar and filters\n\n * Using the filters at the top of the page, you can search for applications by:\n   * Type (e.g. Rostering, SSO, Free)\n     * Please note: Some learning applications do require certain fees to use their products through Clever (e.g. licensing or\n       subscription fees).  Sorting by 'Free' provides a list of learning applications that are completely free to districts.\n\n * Subject (e.g. Assessment, Communication, Math, Reading)\n * Name (e.g. i-Ready, SeeSaw, Big Ideas Math, Achieve3000)\n\n  If the app you are looking for is not available to request, please review this section.\n\n * Once you locate the desired application, select 'Request App' to the right of the selection. \n\n         \n\n * You will then be prompted to authorize the request of the application. You will need to first:\n\n * Select whether or not your district has already purchased the application, or would like to try a free trial of the app (if\n   applicable).  \n * Select a preferred Launch Date for the application. Please note:\n   * The Custom Launch Date you enter is a suggested or preferred date of launch that may later be updated by the application\n     partner if it is not feasible. Please contact app partners directly to adjust app Launch Dates.\n   * The Launch Date is the date the app will become available to all shared district users in their Clever portals.\n   * For rostering apps, view the fields required by the application under the Required fields section. You can determine if your\n     sync can meet these requirements.\n\n           \nExample of a rostering application \n\n\n\nExample of an SSO application\n\n * Once you've made the appropriate selections, select Send integration request to submit the request to the application provider.\n * The application has now been requested! Please see this article to understand the application's status as it progresses to the\n   Launch Date.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nAPPLICATION SHARING PERMISSIONS\n\nOnce the application has approved your connection, you will then specify which sharing type you would like to use in order to\nshare data with the application. These settings will also determine which of your district users will have the application\navailable to them in their individual Portals. Please follow the steps outlined in this guide to set up your sharing permissions\nfor the first time. \n\nAfter the application has been connected, district admins can add or modify the app sharing permissions to determine what district\ndata should be shared with the app, and which district users should have access to the application from their Clever Portals after\nthe Launch Date. The options available are:\n \n\n * Share by District: All district data in Clever will be synced to the application. This includes district admins, schools,\n   teachers, students, staff and sections.  \n * Share by Schools: Clever will only share any data associated with the schools you've selected (e.g. students, teachers,\n   sections, staff). \n * Share by Rules: Clever will only share data that meets the specific criteria you've set. This is the most recommended sharing\n   type as it provides districts with the flexibility in determining specifically what data should be included, or excluded, in\n   the sharing.  Read this article to learn more about how to Share by Rules!\n * School Site Sharing: If your district has designated School Tech Leads in Clever, you can provide them with the ability to\n   configure application sharing permissions for their associated schools. More info here!\n * Copy Sharing: This option will copy the same sharing permissions from another application that has already been set up. \n\nApplications will not have access to any district data in Clever that has not been specifically shared with them via the\napplication sharing permissions. Please visit this article for detailed instructions.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \nWHAT IF MY DESIRED APPLICATION ISN’T LISTED?\n\nIf your desired application is not available to request per the process outlined above:\n\n * SSO or Rostering integrated apps:\n   * This means the app provider has a specific policy that requires them to send districts an invite rather than districts\n     requesting their app (e.g. BrainPOP). Please contact the app partner directly to request their app.\n * Clever Library apps: \n   * Most Library apps can only be added individually by teachers to their Clever Portals. In most cases, these types of apps\n     are not available as district-wide applications. For details, please visit this article .\n * Non-Clever integrated apps: \n   * Clever can build a secure connection for almost any application through our SSO (Saved Passwords) product. SSO (Saved\n     Passwords) applications are apps that don't currently integrate directly with Clever, but can still be accessed through the\n     Clever Portal providing users with a seamless single sign-on experience for the app. \n   * To add an SSO (Saved Passwords) application, select the 'Request [ApplicationName]' below the search results.\n\n             \n * Then, enter some important details to help us configure this SSO (Saved Passwords) application before selecting the 'Request'\n   option.  You will receive an email once the app is ready for your district. For more, please visit: SSO (Saved Passwords) Apps:\n   Overview & Setup.\n\nWe also encourage you to contact non-Clever integrated application providers directly to let them know you’re interested in\nsyncing your data through Clever. Your voice is extremely important as they consider working with us! If you do have a contact at\nthe vendor, feel free to email us at application-interest@clever.com, and we can follow up about building an integration.\n\nFor any app that doesn't require a per-user login, you can also consider adding a link to your Clever Portal for district users.\nLearn more about adding links here!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \nWHAT'S MY APPLICATION'S STATUS?\n\nYou can view the status of all district applications from your Clever Dashboard or by clicking on the application name to open the\napp overview page.\n\nIn the Dashboard you can see the App Status column which lists the status for each of your applications. Next to that is the Next\nstep column which lists the next step that needs to be taken.\n\n\n\nHere's a list including every application status:\n\n * Requested: We're waiting for the application's team to accept your request and proceed with the implementation. If you need to\n   expedite the request process, please reach out to the application provider directly as Clever does not have insight into their\n   review and acceptance process.\n * Invited by app: The app has invited you to connect! They're waiting on you to accept the invitation in your Clever Dashboard. \n * Waiting On Approval: We are still waiting for the application's team to accept your request and proceed with the\n   implementation. District admins can select the 'Remind App' option to the right of the application name from the\n   Clever Home page to remind the application partner of the request. \n\n        \n\n * No Data Shared: The next step is yours! Complete the setup guide to enable data sharing with the application.\n * No Users Selected: The next step is yours! Select which users you want to share with the application.\n * No Credentials Set: The next step is yours! For SSO (Saved Passwords) apps, you will need to set up your district users' login\n   credential requirements for the application. Please see this article for details.\n * Setting Up: Hang tight! The application partner is preparing your district for launch. Users will not be able to access the\n   application until the Launch Date. If you need to expedite the setup process, please reach out to the application partner\n   directly.\n * Launched: Your integration is live! If the application supports SSO, the application is available to users in the Clever\n   Portal. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \nREMOVING AN APPLICATION\n\nIf you would like to remove an application from your district's Clever Portal:\n\n * Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Home page.\n * Click on the application name to open the app overview page.\n * Select the arrow icon on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n * Choose Disconnect App.\n * A dialogue box will open, asking you to select OK to confirm the deletion.\n\n\n\n\nThe application icon will no longer be available in Clever for your district, and your data will be unavailable to the application\nimmediately. If it was a Clever-integrated app, an email notification will be sent to Clever’s main contact from the application's\nteam, informing them that you are no longer sharing your data with them.\n\nPlease note:\n• If you decide to re-add this application to your Clever Dashboard later, your user accounts will likely not be restored\nautomatically. An additional setup will likely be required to match users to their historical data. \n• For Saved Passwords applications, disconnecting the app will delete all credential information (usernames and passwords)\nassociated with the app."

We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n\nLooking for additional support setting up Clever Portal? Check out our Clever Academy Quick Start - Setting up your Portal course\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSSO (Saved Passwords) applications are apps that don't currently have a rostering or single sign-on (SSO) integration with Clever,\nbut can still be accessed via SSO through Clever Portal. This means districts can provide users with a seamless SSO experience for\nalmost any learning application even if it is not an existing Clever partner.  \n\nWith the SSO (Saved Passwords) option, rostering data and user accounts are not synced to the app by Clever. This means they must\nbe created within the application in advance, and user login credentials need to be manually set by the district admin, or by the\nusers themselves. Clever will securely store these credentials so district users are logged into the applications automatically\nvia single sign-on through Clever. \n\nThis article and the video below provides a detailed overview of SSO (Saved Passwords) applications and the setup process for\nlaunching these apps at your district. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\n * District user accounts and credentials for the app:\n   * The first step is to confirm your district users have accounts and login credentials for the SSO (Saved Passwords)\n     application. This would be done by working with the app partner directly before setting the app up in Clever.\n\n * Non-iOS devices:\n   * The second step is confirming the Clever browser extension is installed on all non-iOS devices that will be used to access\n     the application through Clever. This includes home devices for users who will be accessing this app from home. The Clever\n     browser extension facilitates single sign-on for SSO (Saved Passwords) apps. Please visit this article for more.\n     * The Clever browser extension is not required for iOS devices (e.g. iPads, iPhones) as these devices use the Clever app\n       which acts as the browser extension. Please visit this article for more.\n\nPlease note: For devices where the browser extension cannot be downloaded (e.g. Android, Kindle Fire), Saved Passwords apps will\nnot be accessible. For details, visit: Clever Browser & Device Compatibility\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\nAfter configuring the above, there are three steps to set up any application for universal single sign-on (SSO) from your Clever\nPortal.\n\n\n1. Find and add an application\n\nVisit the Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add applications page in your Clever Dashboard to find the application you would like\nto use. Once identified, click Request App. \n\n \n\n\n\nNext, select if you would like to request that the application provider begin supporting rostering via Clever Secure Sync. The\nmore requests Clever receives, the more likely it is to happen in the future.\n\n\nFinally, select Request Application.\n\n\n\n2. Configure user access\n\nThe next screen will provide you with an option to share the added application with particular schools. \nYou can select the schools as listed and select Request with sharing or choose Request and share later. \n\n\n\nSharing rules can always be changed from the individual application's page under Modify user selection.\n\n\n\nClever Tip: For more information on setting up your sharing permissions, check out How do I set my sharing permissions for\napplications? \n\n\n3. Provide your login information\n\n 1. Selecting an example user\n 2. Provide your login information\n\nOnce you have added the application and set up sharing rules, you'll need to provide information on how Clever should log in your\nusers. \n\n\nFirst, select Begin matching on the added application's page: \n\n\n\n\nSome applications require district specific information for logins to work. If this is the case, the first step will prompt you\nfor the information Clever needs. You will need to obtain the information in these fields from the application. Please see the\nexample below: \n\n\n\nYou can then choose whether credentials for this application will be set at a district level or if individual users will set their\nown credentials. \n\n\n\nIf you choose to have individuals set their own credentials, take note of the flow diagram that details the process, and click\nConfirm.\n\n\n\n\nNext, you will need to provide login information: \n\n\n1. SELECTING AN EXAMPLE USER\n\nTo begin matching credentials, select an existing user for the specified user type (e.g. student, teacher, staff). This step is\nmeant to provide you with an example as you configure the credentials for this resource. We suggest entering a user for whom you\nalready have the username and password. Once you have selected a user, you will see the data that’s synced from your SIS populated\nin the box below.\n\n\n\n\n2. CHOOSING A FORMULA TYPE\n\nNext, you will choose a formula type for both Username and Password.\n\n\n\nYou can choose from the following:\n\n * Exact user attribute\n   * This setting will pull data fields from a user’s profile as it is synced from your SIS. If we are not currently pulling in\n     the fields you need, then reach out to Clever support to investigate possible alternate mappings.\n * Manual input from user at first login\n   * This setting allows users to input their own credentials the first time they access the Saved Passwords resource via the\n     Clever Portal. These credentials will be saved for all future logins.\n * Custom Formula\n   * You can use existing fields in the user’s profile to form custom strings for the Username/Password. Please see this Help\n     Center article: How do I manage Saved Passwords application credentials?\n * CSV via SFTP\n   * When a user's credentials are uploaded via CSV, they will not be asked to log in the first time they access the application\n     through Clever. \n   * Upload a file containing each user’s credentials using SFTP. You can find the SFTP credentials in your Clever Dashboard >\n     Sync > Settings page under CREDENTIALS SFTP SETTINGS\n * One time CSV upload\n   * Upload a file containing each user’s credentials directly to the site using drag and drop.\n\n\nYou may choose any combination of these options for your username and password configurations. Once you have completed both\nfields, you will see a preview of the credentials in the card on the left. Click Confirm to save those changes. You can return and\nedit your formulas by clicking on the corresponding card on the left.\n\n\nFor additional instructions, please visit: How do I manage Saved Passwords application credentials?\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n\nWhy do these applications require a lengthy setup?\n\n * SSO (Saved Passwords) applications are not formally integrated with Clever. Our engineering team works to create a connection\n   that will serve your users in the most seamless way possible! In order for our connection to work smoothly, we require you to\n   set up the application beforehand and ask that you provide us with credentials. While these applications do take a bit more\n   setup time, your users will enjoy a seamless experience once everything is done.\n\n\nWhat device(s) can I use with Saved Passwords applications?\n\n * Applications with Saved Passwords can be used on any devices that support browser extensions with Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.\n   Desktop computers, laptops, Chromebooks, and Windows devices are all supported. Saved Passwords is also supported on iOS\n   devices running on iOS 9.0 and above with the most up to date Clever app installed.\n\nSaved Passwords functionality on iOS For more information on how to set this up, please see Clever Saved Passwords for iOS \n\n\nCan we use Google / Active Directory / Entra ID / Office365 to log into an application via Clever? \n\n * SSO (Saved Passwords) apps will only function properly with applications that allow for a standard username and password. They\n   will not work with any applications where the district uses a third-party identity provider  (e.g. Google) to log in to the\n   application directly.\n * If your district uses Google to log into Clever, you can add the application as an external link on your Clever Dashboard.\n   Since there is an active Google session on the device, the user should not need to re-authenticate when they click Log in with\n   Google on the application's website. \n\n\nWhat if I don't see an application I want?\n\n * Check out Requesting a single sign-on (SSO) application\n\nWhat if the application requires a specific login URL for my district?\n\n * If the application has a specific login URL for your district, follow the steps below to enter that URL\n\n1.

Testing unsuccessful logins\n5. If anything goes wrong...\n6. If everything goes right...\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBefore you roll out a new Saved Passwords application to all users in your district, we recommend testing a few logins. In most\ncases, users will need to enter their login credentials the very first time they access the application but will be automatically\nlogged in via single sign-on (SSO) each time thereafter.\n \n\nFor devices other than iOS, please make sure that you are using a Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, or Internet Explorer (2013 or\nlater) browser, and have the Clever browser extension installed.  For iOS devices, you will need to use the Clever app as it\nfunctions as the Clever browser extension for Saved Passwords apps. \n\n Visit these articles for details about the Clever browser extension, Saved Passwords apps on iOS devices, or managing user\ncredentials!\n\n\n\nTESTING FUNCTIONALITY FOR DIFFERENT USERS\n\nTo ensure students and teachers are being logged into the app successfully, you'll need credentials from both user types for\nClever Portal and the Saved Passwords application you are testing.\n \n\nBefore testing, it is important to make sure the users are shared with the application and have the app icon in their Clever\nPortals. To do this, navigate to your Clever Clever Dashboard > Home page, and click on the application name to open the app\noverview page.  Confirm the users you are testing are shared with the application via the 'Select Users' tab.\n \n\n\nTESTING SUCCESSFUL LOGINS\n\nFrom your Clever Dashboard, use the 'Access Portal as' feature to log in as a student or teacher. Click on the app icon and enter\nthe correct credentials for the application. Once you click 'Save Login' you should be brought to the application website and\nsuccessfully logged in.\n \n\nClever Tip: If the application has different login URLs for each school, make sure to test a few different student and teacher\naccounts to make sure they all work as expected. If you are unsure how to set up school-specific login URLs, please contact Clever\nSupport!\n\n\n\nTESTING UNSUCCESSFUL LOGINS\n\nYou'll also want to make sure you know what to do when things go wrong! To test what happens when a user is logged in\nunsuccessfully, use the 'Access Portal as' feature to log in as a student or teacher. Click on the app icon and enter the wrong\ncredentials. You should see a page that looks like this:\n\n\n\nEnter the correct credentials, and select 'Update & Log in' to reset the user's credentials. \n\n If you have any issues updating the credentials, or if you need additional instructions on troubleshooting logins, please\nvisit this article!\n\n\n\nIF ANYTHING GOES WRONG...\n\nIf any of the tests above don't go as expected, let us know! We're always looking for ways to improve our Saved Passwords\napplication integrations, so your feedback is very much appreciated. As always, any screenshots you can provide will make the\ntroubleshooting process that much easier.\n\n\nIF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT...\n\nIf the tests above work as expected, we recommend piloting the Saved Passwords application with a subset of students and teachers\nbefore rolling it out to the entire district. Here are a few quick steps for creating a successful Saved Passwords pilot:\n \n\n 1. First, you'll want to complete the steps above to ensure users are being logged into the Saved Passwords app successfully. If\n    you run into any issues you can submit a ticket to our support team.\n 2. Choose a few classrooms to pilot the Saved Passwords application. We recommend choosing classes with students who are old\n    enough to log into the application easily outside of Clever in case of any hiccups.\n 3. Provide them with login instructions, and allow them to test from their Clever Portals to ensure they are logged into the app\n    successfully.\n\nYou can find more information about SSO (Saved Passwords) applications here."

Uploading Credentials\n7. Reset or Remove credentials for users\n\n \n\n Read SSO (Saved Passwords) Apps: Overview & Setup first to learn how to add SSO (Saved Passwords) applications to your Clever\nPortal!\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSSO (Saved Passwords) applications have the ability to provide your users with a seamless SSO experience despite Clever not having\na formal integration with the application you have added. In order for SSO to work properly with your SSO (Saved Passwords)\napplications, you will need to ensure that you have set up credentials correctly. This article will describe the options that you\nhave as well as provide you with directions on how you can manage credentials. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMANAGING CREDENTIALS\n\nOnce an application has been added to your Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add Applications page, the next step is to input\nusername and password information for your users to log into the SSO (Saved Passwords) application. You can manage credentials by\nnavigating to the 'Settings' tab of the specific application's Manage Credentials page. This article will go over multiple options\nfor setting up your users' credentials for the specified application.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMANUAL INPUT FROM USER AT FIRST LOGIN\n\nBy default, we will request that users enter their credentials manually the first time. After the first time, they will be\nautomatically logged into their application with one click.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMATCHING CREDENTIALS\n\nIf usernames and passwords can be found in your SIS information, you can select which field this information is contained in by\nselecting the drop-down menu.  The field options are as follows:\n\n * District username, district password, date of birth, email, SIS ID, student number & state ID\n\n\n\n>\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCUSTOM CREDENTIALS\n\nTo match the usernames/passwords created outside of Clever for SSO (Saved Passwords) applications, you can use the \"Custom\" option\nin the dropdown and use a formula from below. More information about custom formulas can be found here.\n\nAvailable fields: \n\n * {{credentials.district_username}} = username from SIS sync\n * {{credentials.district_password}} = password from SIS sync\n * {{name.first}} = first name from SIS sync\n * {{name.last}} = last name from SIS sync\n * {{email}} = email from SIS sync\n * {{student_number}} = student number from SIS sync\n * {{_id}} = Clever ID \n * {{sis_id}} = SIS ID from SIS sync (student_id, teacher_id, staff_id)\n * {{graduation_year}} = graduation year from SIS sync\n * {{dob}} = birthday from SIS sync\n\n \n\nDesired username or passwordFormula [fill in portions in brackets]Example formulaSample result for an example userUsername from\nthe sync plus my district's email domain{{credentials.district_username}}[add domain name\nhere]{{credentials.district_username}}@cleverusd.eduskelly19@cleverusd.edu A specific word/phrase that's the same for every\nstudent[add that word/phrase here]appleappleInsert the whole contents of a field from either the SIS sync or the .csv\nupload{{FIELD NAME}}{{graduation_year}}2030First initial, last name{{substr name.first 0 1}}{{name.last}}{{substr name.first 0\n1}}{{name.last}}skellyTheir email without the domain{{textBefore email \"@\"}}{{textBefore email \"@\"}}sykellyLast 4 digits of a\nfield{{substr FIELDNAME -4 4}}{{substr student_number -4 4}}5678Something else...Contact us via the form in our Help Center and\nwe'll create a formula for you!\nCustom formulas are complicated and are most easily communicated via email.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nUPLOADING CREDENTIALS\n\nWhen a user's credentials are uploaded via CSV, they will not be asked to log in the first time they access the application\nthrough Clever. If a user is not included in the credentials upload, the expected behavior is they will be prompted to manually\nenter their credentials at their first login, and then will be automatically logged in each time thereafter.\n\n\nMethod 1: Upload via Clever \n\nYou can securely upload credentials directly from the 'Settings' tab of the specific application's Manage Credentials page. To do\nso, first select Manual upload from .csv as the username and password which will enable a web upload tool to upload your CSV file.\nThis does state \"not recommended\", this is due to the complexity of creating the files and managing the credentials on the\ndistrict's end. \n\n\n\n\nUpload the file and select Save. We have also provided a downloadable template for reference.\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: SFTP Upload\n\nYou can upload user credentials via the Credentials SFTP server. Files should be in the form of students.csv, teachers.csv, or\nstaff.csv and uploaded to the appropriate folder for the application (e.g. /career-cruising). See tips to format your files to\nsuccessfully upload credentials or download template files.\n\n\nThe username and password of your Credentials SFTP connection are the same as for your SIS sync SFTP connection, and can be found\nunder the Sync Settings:\n\n\n\nFor more information on the tools that you can use to access and upload files to your credentials SFTP server, please see this\nHelp Center article: What are some recommended tools for SFTP syncs?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nFORMATTING CREDENTIALS UPLOADS\n\nSSO (Saved Passwords) applications in the Clever Portal accept three files for setup: students.csv, teachers.csv, and staff.csv.\nPlease find the specification on formatting below.\n\nSeparate setup files are required for every SSO (Saved Passwords) application, even if the credentials used are the same for all\napplications.\n\nGeneric specifications for students.csv\n\n\n\nGeneric specifications for teachers.csv\n\n\n\n\nGeneric specifications for staff.csv\n\n\n\n\nUploading credentials: special cases\n\nSome applications require more than just a username and password. For example, the application may require a school code or a pin\nnumber. For these applications, you will need to include an additional column in your credential upload. The required fields will\nbe reflected on the 'Upload Credentials' page and will look something like this:\n\n\n\nYou will also use an extra column when your users sign into an application from multiple URLs (i.e. URLs that are unique for each\nschool in a district).\n\n\nTroubleshooting upload issues\n\nOnce you upload credentials, you'll receive a confirmation email with a summary of your upload. If there are any issues, the email\nwill also list the number of rows that could not be processed. Here are some of the most common issues that prevent rows from\nbeing processed and how to resolve them:\n\n 1. Missing data: All of the fields listed on the 'Upload Credentials' tab of an application are required. Double-check that\n    you're not missing any additional rows (see \"Uploading Credentials: Special Cases\" above) and that none of your rows have\n    empty cells in them.\n 2. Incorrect user IDs: Each User_ID must exactly match the SIS_ID of the user you are uploading credentials for. You can check\n    each user's SIS_ID in your Clever Dashboard > Data browser.\n    * Please note: Leading zeros (i.e. the \"000\" in \"000123\") do matter. If your users' SIS_IDs have leading zeros, make sure the\n      zeros aren't getting stripped in your upload file.\n 3. Duplicate rows: Clever will only process the first set of credentials for each User_ID. If a User_ID is included in multiple\n    rows, all rows past the first will be listed as errors.\n 4. Formatting errors: Sometimes simple formatting errors such as incorrect capitalization can cause errors. Make sure your\n    headers match exactly what is listed on the 'Uploading Credentials' tab. Also, make sure you are saving the file as a CSV.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nRESET OR REMOVE CREDENTIALS FOR USERS\n\n\nRESETTING CREDENTIALS IN BULK\n\nTo remove previously uploaded credentials for a SSO (Saved Passwords) application, please follow these steps: \n\n 1. Navigate to the application in the Clever Dashboard\n 2. Select Settings\n 3. Select Manage credentials\n 4. (Optional) Adjust credentials for the correct user type if necessary.\n 5. Select Confirm\n 6. (Optional) Adjust student credentials if needed. Select Confirm\n 7. Select Done\n 8. Check the box labeled Delete these credentials and apply new settings\n 9. Click Match credentials\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRESETTING CREDENTIALS FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS\n\nIf your students enter in the incorrect credentials for their applications the first time they log in, teachers have the ability\nto update these passwords!\n\n 1. Click on My Students and then Student Roster in the drop-down\n     \n    \n    \n 2. Select the student that needs help, then click Troubleshoot app login in the student menu that appears.\n     \n    \n    \n 3. Search for the application and select that the student can see the application in their portal\n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 4. Click on set or update credentials. This will allow you to set/update the student’s credentials, allowing them to access the\n    saved password application the next time they log in through their Clever Portal"

How do I edit the sharing permissions for an application once the setup guide has been completed?\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will walk you through sharing data with an application once the application has accepted your request to connect via\nClever.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE APPLICATION SHARING PERMISSIONS?\n\nOnce an application has been added to a district's Clever Portal, district admins configure sharing permissions in order to\ndetermine what data should be shared with the app, and which district users should be able to access the application from their\nindividual Clever Portals.\n\nApplications will not have access to any district data in Clever that has not been specifically shared with them via the\napplication sharing permissions.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DO I START SHARING DATA WITH AN APPLICATION?\n\nClever acts as a repository that stores the data from a district's student information system (SIS) which is then shared with each\napplication. A district might share different data with each unique application depending on the application type, licensing\ncontingencies, and so on. In Clever, this is done by setting up sharing permissions.\n\nClever offers two experiences for sharing data: Guided Sharing and Standard Sharing.\n\n * Guided Sharing is best for new users or those who don't set up sharing settings often.\n * Standard sharing is best for experienced Clever users or those who need to use School Site Sharing.\n\nThe choice in experience is custom to each user -- a new admin at your district can choose to use Guided Sharing while an admin\nwith more Clever experience may choose Standard Sharing.\n\nUsers can choose to switch between these two experiences at any time by selecting Edit Sharing for an application and selecting\nSwitch Sharing setup view in the top right. Your choice in sharing experience will be remembered and used anytime you edit sharing\npermissions for an app.\n\nHere’s how to set your data sharing permissions for an application for the first time:\n\n * From your Clever Clever Dashboard > Home page, click on an application name to be directed to the application’s overview page.\n * Select ‘Begin setup’ and follow the steps in the guide to finalize your connection with the application.\n\nFor your convenience, we are providing sharing instructions for both Standard and Guided sharing.\n \n\n\nSTANDARD SHARING\n\n\nSTEP 1: SET SHARING\n\nYou’ll specify which sharing type you would like to use in order to share data with the application. These settings will also\ndetermine which of your district users will have the application available to them in their individual Portals.\n\nYou have five options for how to share data:\n\n1. Use the application’s sharing recommendation\n2. Copy sharing rules from another app\n * * If you select this option, all records that are shared with the chosen application will also be shared with the one you're\n     currently setting up.\n   * Please note: copying the sharing only happens once - if you make changes to sharing with the original application, they will\n     not be reflected in the app you're currently setting up (or vice versa)\n\n3. Share all records in the district \n * * If you select this option, all schools, students, teachers, and sections in the district will be shared. You will also have\n     the option to include staff in the data sharing with the application.\n\n4. Share all records for specific schools\n * * If you select this option all students, students, teachers, sections, and staff associated with the selected schools will be\n     shared with the application.\n\n5. Customize your sharing\n * * Select ‘Click here to customize your sharing’ to navigate to the data sharing page to configure customized sharing rules.\n     Read this article to learn more about how to share by rules.\n   * Once you've selected your sharing type, select 'Save' to move on to step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: DATA VALIDATION\n\nOnce you’ve shared data, we’ll check for issues that might prevent a record from being synced.\nPlease note that you may need to wait a few minutes while we process your sharing settings. Any data error and warnings will\nappear on this page when processing is completed.\n\n\n\n * If you see an error, this means that the flagged records will not be accessible in the application - users will not be able to\n   log in and data will be missing.\n * If you see a warning, this means that the flagged records will be accessible but users may have a degraded experience within\n   the application.\n * If you have data that is flagged, please review the impacted records carefully. We recommend resolving as many of these data\n   quality issues as possible to ensure that all of the data is successfully synced with the application and all desired users are\n   able to access the application.\n   * For more information on resolving these data warnings and errors, check out our guide to data warnings and errors.\n\nOnce you've reviewed any data quality issues, select 'Next' to move on to step 3.\n\n\nSTEP 3: FINALIZE SETUP\n\n * Now that you have enabled data sharing with the application and resolved any data quality issues, the application connection is\n   complete!\n * For some applications, you will need to take additional steps to finalize the app connection. Those additional steps will be\n   outlined on this page.\n * For single sign-on (SSO) applications, users will be able to access the application on the launch date.\n\n\n\n * Once you have read the instructions to finalize your app connection, select 'Finish'.\n * If you need to go back to edit the sharing rules for an application, feel free to reference this guide for more information\n   about the different types of sharing permissions.\n\n\nGUIDED SHARING\n\n\nSTEP 1: CHOOSE SHARING METHOD\n\n * Choose your sharing method. There are multiple data sharing options.\n   * Create new sharing settings specific to the application\n   * Use the application’s suggested data sharing template (if provided)\n   * Copy another app’s data sharing rules\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: CHOOSE WHO NEEDS ACCESS\n\n * Set up access for specific sections, teachers, students, and/or staff\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: PREVIEW & SHARE USER DATA\n\n * You can preview your sharing rules and, if everything looks correct, share your schools’ data with the application\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I EDIT THE SHARING PERMISSIONS FOR AN APPLICATION ONCE THE SETUP GUIDE HAS BEEN COMPLETED?\n\nTo edit sharing permissions, from your Clever Dashboard > Home page, click on the application's name to open their overview\npage. Under Shared Data, select Edit sharing. You can reference this guide for more information about the different types of\nsharing permissions.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * Sharing Permissions: Guided Sharing\n * Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules"

More\ninformation on this resource can be found here. \n\n\n\nAPPLICATION IS MISSING FROM THE CLEVER PORTAL\n\nIf a user does not see an application in the Clever Portal, there are a few things you can check: \n \n\n 1. Does the application support SSO?\n\n\n 2. Does the application support SSO for this user type?\n\n\n 3. Is the user successfully shared with the application? More information on constructing sharing rules can be found here.\n\nIf sharing by district: confirm the user is active in Clever.\nIf sharing by school: confirm the user is associated with the school or is associated with at least one section at the shared\nschool.\nIf sharing by rules: confirm the user meets all criteria for at least one of the sharing rules. The most common criteria that\nresult in users not being shared are not meeting the requirements for enrolled sections. Ensure that they are enrolled in a\nsection that meets the grade level, subject, course, etc. that is being shared with the application. You can review the Clever\nprofile for a user, including associated sections, by using the search feature, located at the top of your Clever Dashboard.  \n \n 4. Is the user successfully shared with the application? Use the Troubleshoot Sharing tool to confirm. More information on this\n    resource can be found here.\n 5. Check to make sure that the application hasn't been hidden from users by a Clever Admin. You can find more information here:\n    Clever Portal: Hiding Applications.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nUSER IS NOT LOGGED IN AFTER CLICKING ON THE APPLICATION ICON IN THE CLEVER PORTAL \n\nIf a user clicks on an app icon in their Clever Portal and receives an error from the application's website page, please contact\nthe application's support team for assistance. \n \n\n\n\nIf the user clicks on the app icon and receives an error that is a Clever website, please contact Clever's support team with the\nerror message.\n\nPlease note: If the user has recently changed schools or classes, or was recently synced to Clever, please allow 24 hours for\ntheir connected applications to be updated so they can log in.\n\nClever Tip: If you are seeing an error at a web URL that is not a Clever address, it will be necessary to contact the application\nto fix the issue. Please reach out to the application's support team to investigate further!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUSING THE ACCESS PORTAL AS FEATURE TO TROUBLESHOOT\n\nUsing the Access Portal As feature on your Clever Dashboard is a great way to troubleshoot and to support teachers and students\nwith their technical issues. Clever makes it easy for District Admins to access the Clever Portal as an individual teacher or\nstudent and see exactly what they see. When troubleshooting, this can help diagnose an issue, retrieve an error code or message\n(this is especially helpful to provide to the application or Clever Support), or gain visibility into what might be confusing. The\nAccess Portal As feature should only be used for viewing purposes and you should never edit anything as another user. This feature\nis not available to access staff (non-instructional) accounts.\n\nYou can access this feature when on teacher or student profile pages by clicking on the Support Tools button in the upper right\ncorner and selecting Access Portal as the user.\n\n\n\n\nYou will then be taken to a screen to Start Portal session, which will take you to the user's Portal.\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to log out of the user's Portal once you are done by clicking End Portal session in the upper right corner."

Navigate to the Troubleshoot Sharing tool\n \n2. Select a user using Clever ID, SIS ID, Name, or Email and select the Application Name\n\n\nThe tool will immediately check if the user is shared\n\n \n3. Review the Sharing Status\n\n\n \nThe user is not shared with the application. As a result, they will not have an account created in the application nor will see\nthe application in their Clever Portal. \n\n\n\nThe user is shared with the application. If the application supports rostering, the student will have an account created in the\napplication. If the application supports Single Sign-On (SSO), the user will see the application in their Clever Portal. \n\n\n4. Review the Next Steps\n\nBelow the sharing status, Clever will provide recommendations on how to share or unshare an application with a user.\n\n\n\nThe two most common adjustments are: \n\nOption 1 (RECOMMENDED): Update the user in your student information system (SIS). \nThis usually involves enrolling the student in a specific section or school in your SIS. The most common issue is the user is not\nenrolled in a section with a specific subject or grade level.\n\nOption 2: Update the app's sharing rules\nIf a user is not shared, you can always update or add a sharing rule that matches the properties for that user. Directions for\nupdating sharing rules can be found here. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMATCH TYPES\n\nThe Troubleshoot Sharing tool will run an analysis across all sharing rules for the selected application. For each rule, it will\nreturn one of the following match types. \n\nA user will be shared with an application if at least one (1) rule is a \"Matching\" rule.\n \n\nMatch type\n\nDescription\n\nMatchingThe user matches all the rule's requirements to be shared with the application. Matching rules are outlined in green.\n\nExample:\n\nThe user is associated with a school that is shared. Since this satisfies all criteria for the rule, the user is shared.Partial\nMatching\n \n\nThe user matches some, but not all, the rule's requirements to be shared with the application.\n\nExample: \n\n\nThis user is associated with a school that is shared, is enrolled in a section grade is 3-6, but is not enrolled in a section that\nsection name contains 'math'. Since the user does not meet all criteria, the user is not shared via the rule. \n\nNon-MatchingThe user does not match any of the rule's requirements to be shared with the application\n\nExample: \n\nThis user is not associated with a section at a school listed. Since the user does not meet any criteria, the user is not shared\nvia the rule."

Click here to make a suggestion! \n\n \n\nRecord Type\n\nProblem\n\nDescription\n\nStudentStudent not sharedThe most common reason that a student is not shared with an app is:\n * The student is not enrolled in a section that meets sharing requirements\n\nTo resolve the issue, enroll the student in a qualifying section in the SIS and sync with Clever. \n StudentStudent shared that should not be sharedThe most common reasons that a student is shared with an app in error are: \n * The student is enrolled in sections at multiple schools and their additional school is being shared with the app\n * The student is enrolled in a section where students of a different grade level are being shared. If a section is shared, all\n   students associated with the section are shared with the application, regardless of the student’s grade level. \n\nAs a workaround for these scenarios, custom sections may be utilized as outlined here.\n TeacherTeacher not sharedThe most common reasons that a teacher is not shared with an app are:\n * The teacher is not enrolled in sections in the SIS / Clever. \n * The sections they teach do not meet sharing requirements. \n\nTo resolve the issue, either enroll the teacher in a section in the SIS or add a Custom Share by Teacher rule for the app.\n TeacherTeacher shared that should not be sharedThe most common reasons that a teacher is shared with an app in error are: \n * The teacher is enrolled in sections at multiple schools and their additional school is being shared with the app\n * The teacher is a co-teacher on a section that is shared\n * The teacher is enrolled in a section where students of a different grade level are being shared. If a section is shared, all\n   teachers and students associated with the section are shared with the application, regardless of the teacher or student’s grade\n   level. \n\nAs a workaround for these scenarios, custom sections may be utilized as outlined here.\n StaffStaff are not sharedStaff are shared if sharing by school. If using sharing rules, an additional Custom Share by Staff rule\nis required.\n Student ContactsStudent contacts are not sharedStudent contacts are shared with an application using Field Access permissions.\nWhen enabled, all contacts are shared – filtering is not available. \n Student ContactsToo many student contacts are sharedStudent contacts are shared with an application using Field\nAccess permissions. When enabled, all contacts are shared – filtering is not available. \n\nIf you wish to only share a subset of student contacts, the filter must be applied to your SIS sync, which will remove the\ntargeted contacts from Clever entirely. \n District AdminsDistrict Admins are not shared / synced to app\n\nAll Clever Admins, District Curriculum Leads, and District Help Desk are shared with all applications.\n\nSharing of District Admins cannot be controlled per user. A district can choose to share all District Admins (default behavior) or\nto completely disable sharing of District Admins using Field Access controls. \n\n\n\nApplication partners may choose whether to support rostering and SSO for these users. If interested in rostering or SSO for\nDistrict Admins, please contact the application partner's support team for more information on what options are available for\nDistrict Admins.\n\nFor applications that support Rostering and/or SSO, the application determines all permissions granted within the application.\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCHECK TO SEE IF A USER IS SHARED WITH THE APP\n\nFour methods that work for understanding if a user is shared by a rule are below!\n \n\nMethod\n\nHow to utilize the method\n\nSearch for the app in the app section on the user's profileSteps:\n\n 1. Open a second tab of your Clever Dashboard\n\n 2. Search for the user (or locate them in the Data Browser) and open their profile page\n\n 3.

Troubleshooting Errors on the Sync History page\n5. Using the Google Classroom Course Information Lookup Tool\n6. As-Needed: Reprovision any courses that teachers declined by accident\n7. FAQs\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n➕ The Google Classroom roster import application is available to request in the Clever application gallery! \n\n\nU.S. and Canadian school districts with a Google Workspace for Education Plus subscription for staff and students have the option\nto roster Google Classroom courses via Clever. If you’re interested in utilizing this rostering method, please visit your Clever\nDashboard to accept your invite or request the application.\n\nOnce the application is connected and the scheduled sync start date has arrived, Clever will provision Google Classroom courses\nbased on your district’s SIS + Clever data. Google Classroom course names will match to Clever section names and rosters will\nupdate automatically as students change sections in your SIS + Clever.\n\nThe Google Classroom roster import application will:\n\n  Create Classroom courses and enroll students and teachers based on Clever section data.\n  Automatically update rosters based on changes in Clever.\n  Allow teachers to manually add and remove students and co-teachers to Clever-created courses.\n  Allow teachers to rename Clever-created courses.\n  Allow teachers to accept or reject Clever-created courses.\n  Add co-teachers to Clever-created courses.\n\n\nThe application will NOT:\n \n\n  Create, modify, or delete user accounts in Google Workspace.\n  Modify courses that teachers manually create in Classroom.\n  Write Classroom grades back to your district’s SIS (but should be compatible with other grade passback solutions).\n  Overwrite changes that teachers make to their courses, such as the course name\n  Sync any Guardian info to Classroom or modify/overwrite any Guardian data\n\n \n\nIf you are already the district administrator for a Clever account, you can request Google Classroom Roster Import from your\nClever Dashboard > Applications > Add Applications page. Districts interested in Classroom rostering who do not already use Clever\ncan create a Clever account here to request the application.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n \n\n * Districts must have a Google Workspace for Education Plus subscription for staff and students in order to utilize the Google\n   Classroom roster import application via Clever. If your district has questions about upgrading to Education Plus,\n   please contact na-k12-gwfe@google.com. \n   * If your district has a paid 'legacy' subscription (also called “G Suite Enterprise for Education”) for staff and students\n     then your district has access to this tool. To maintain access your district will need to renew the Education Plus tier when\n     you are up for renewal.\n * One of your district's Clever Admins will need to coordinate with your district’s Google Workspace Super Administrator for the\n   initial setup of Google Classroom roster import.\n   * The domain for the Super Admin (_ ex @school.org_) must match the domain for your teacher's Google Accounts (also\n     @school.org). For more info, see the setup guide here. \n * If you’re interested in finding out about your Google Workspace subscription or for help identifying your Google Workspace\n   Super Admin, please log into your Google admin console.\n * Teachers, students and the Super Administrator can be in different subdomains, but they must all be part of the same primary\n   domain.\n * The application requires all Classroom users to have their Email field in Clever populated with the Google email. The emails\n   need to already be provisioned. This Classroom rostering application does not generate any user accounts.\n   * For help with generating user accounts, read here for more info on Clever IDM!\n\n \n\n\nTEACHER EXPERIENCE\n\nOnce rostering is turned on for Google Classroom then teachers will have the option to accept Clever-created courses. They can\nalso reject them and continue managing their rosters manually. Courses created outside Clever will not be modified or deleted by\nthe Clever connection.\n\n\n \n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING ERRORS ON THE SYNC HISTORY PAGE\n\nIf you notice that some rostering data is not successfully populating within Google Classroom automatically, please review the\nGoogle Classroom roster import Sync History page of your Clever Dashboard.\n\nFrom that page, you will be able to download CSV files of the sync errors or successfully synced reports:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Please note: When sections match, we may or may not have updated the class. It'll also show as an update, but this doesn't mean\nthat anything changed. It's just indicating that it is the new current state of the Google Classroom class.\n\n\n \n\n\nBELOW ARE SOME SYNC ERRORS YOU MIGHT SEE, WHAT THEY MEAN, AND HOW YOU CAN RESOLVE THEM!\n\n\nError: 403: @CannotDirectAddUser - Unable to directly add the user to the course. Please check that the user account exists and is\nwithin the course admin's domain.\n\n * Reason: The user can’t be added because they are in a different domain (e.g. gmail.com or @student.school.org) or their Google\n   account could not be found.\n * Resolution: Look up the user’s email in Clever and Google and make sure the user’s email address matches an active,\n   already-created Google account that belongs to the primary Workspace domain.\n\n\nError: 400: @UserAccountSuspended - The user account specified in the request is suspended\n\n * Reason: The user's Google account has been suspended. The user is still active in the SIS/Clever data and being shared with\n   Google Classroom roster import.\n * Resolution: Check Google and the SIS to ensure that the user account is active in both systems or is removed in Clever.\n\n \n\nError: 403: The caller does not have permission – unable to create Course because of issue with primary teacher\n\n * Reason: The teacher account has not been created in Google Workspace or is in a separate domain than the Super Admin.\n * Resolution: Contact Google Workspace Support if you need help managing your synced users and subdomains. Teacher accounts\n   should be created before syncing and the Super Admin should be able to manage all of the users who are synced with Classroom\n   roster import.\n\n \n\nError: 400: @JoiningUserNotEnabledForRosterImport Joining user is not enabled for SIS Roster Import via the current integrator\n(Clever).\n\n * Reason: Your latest Google Classroom sync was unsuccessful because Clever is not enabled as your rostering provider.\n * Resolution: Please have your Google Workspace super administrator visit the Google Admin Console to select ON-CLEVER under\n   Roster Import. To navigate to Roster Import, go to Apps > Google Workspace > Settings for Classroom > Roster Import.\n\n \n\nError: 403: Request had insufficient authentication scopes. Reconnect Clever with a Google Super Admin account.\n\n * Reason: Your latest Google Classroom sync failed because the sync did not have permission from a Super Admin account to modify\n   your data in Classroom.\n * Resolution:  Please visit the settings page and use the Disconnect button under Google Authentication. Then press the Reconnect\n   button and accept all of the requested permissions with a Google Super Admin account.  \n\n\nError: 400: Bad Request - invalid_grant - token has been expired or revoked\n\n * Reason: Your latest Google Classroom sync failed because the connection between Clever and Google Classroom has broken.\n * Resolution: Please visit the settings page and reconnect Clever with a Google Super Admin account, making sure to include all\n   of the requested permissions.  \n\n\nError: 400: admin_policy_enforced\n\n * Reason: Your latest Google Classroom connection failed because your Google Workspace domain has blocked the connection to\n   Clever.\n * Resolution:  Navigate to the Google Workspace Admin console and add this Client ID to your allowlist:\n   598262247637-f2nenipsam9fohv8dfleifqbgbae8gui.apps.googleusercontent.com \n\n\nError: Could not remove student: Unknown email for [student Clever ID]\n\n * Reason: This student has been removed from Clever, so the system is unable to remove them from the Google Classroom roster.\n * Resolution: You may need to delete their accounts manually in Google if they're still present on that end, or just ignore these\n   messages if they are already missing there too. \n\n \n\nError: 403: The Super Admin user is not permitted to access Classroom\n\n * Reason: Your latest Google Classroom sync was unsuccessful because the Google Classroom service is disabled for the Super Admin\n   connected to Clever.\n * Resolution:  Visit the Google Admin Console to enable the Classroom service for that user. See here for info about controlling\n   user access to Classroom.\n\n \n\nError: 400: Precondition check failed - user account is disabled\n\n * Reason:  The student or teacher account is disabled.\n * Resolution:  Check on the status of the user’s account within Workspace.\n\n \n\nError: 404: The course was not found\n\n * Reason:  The user could not be added to the course because the course could not be found. It has been archived or deleted.\n * Resolution:  Contact Clever Support if you need help checking on the status of this course. \n\n \n\nError: Unknown email for the primary teacher on the section.\n\n * Reason:  The primary teacher’s email in Clever is unknown to Workspace.\n * Resolution:  Check the email for the primary teacher on the section in Clever and Workspace to make sure it is correct and\n   active in Workspace.\n\n \n\nError: 400: Course member limit reached\n\n * Reason:  The course has reached the limit of active users tied to it.\n * Resolution:  The primary teacher can add or remove co-teachers manually. The sync will not add teachers as long as the course\n   member limit has been reached. See this article for more information.\n\n \n\nError: 400: User course limit reached\n\n * Reason:  The user has reached the limit on the number of courses joined and cannot be added to this course.\n * Resolution:  The user cannot be added as long as the limit on the number of courses joined has been reached. Check in Clever\n   and Classroom to determine why this user is tied to a high # of courses. See this article for more information.\n\n \n\nError: 400: Cannot remove course owner\n\n * Reason:  The course owner may not be removed.\n * Resolution:  If you'd like to remove a teacher from a class, transfer the ownership of the class to another teacher, then\n   remove the teacher.\n\n \n\nError: 400: Ineligible Course Owner\n\n * Reason:  Only a teacher with a valid account can be invited as owner of a course.\n * Resolution: Verify that the requested owner has an active Google account. If they do, please contact Clever support .\n\n \n\nError: 404: Requested entity was not found\n\n * Reason:  The course or user could not be found in Google Classroom. \n * Resolution: The course that couldn’t be found may have been declined, archived, or deleted. The teacher can create the course\n   manually. For ‘user not found’ check if the email in Clever matches an existing account in Google Workspace. \n\n \n\n\n USING THE GOOGLE CLASSROOM COURSE INFORMATION LOOKUP TOOL\n\n\nYou can follow these steps to determine the current state that a course is in, within Google Classroom, from inside of the Clever\nDashboard!\n\n1. Navigate to the Profile View for a section in your Clever Dashboard. A quick way to do this is to search for and navigate to a\nsection via the search bar at the top of Clever Dashboard:\n\n\n\n2. On the section’s profile page - scroll down to the Google Classroom Course Information lookup tool.\n3. Click the button to look up the current state of the Course within Classroom:\n\n\n4. Note the Google ID # and Google State. These can be used for further troubleshooting and to understand the current status of a\nCourse:\n\n\n\n5. Here is information about the different Course ‘states’ that you could see:\n\nActive: The course is active.\nArchived: The course has been archived. Teachers can un-archive courses themselves.\nProvisioned: The course has been created, but not yet activated. It is accessible by the primary teacher and domain\nadministrators, who may modify it or change it to the ACTIVE or DECLINED states.\nDeclined: The course has been created, but declined. Contact Clever Support if you need to un-decline a course.\n \n\n\nAS-NEEDED: REPROVISION ANY COURSES THAT TEACHERS DECLINED BY ACCIDENT\n\n\nBe sure to let your teachers know that they need to accept the synced courses in Google Classroom! If you need to reprovision any\ncourses that teachers declined by accident, Clever Admins can do that from the section's profile page in the Clever Dashboard: \n\n\n \n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhat will the courses be named when they sync to Google Classroom?\n\n * Clever-created courses will utilize the section name in Clever as the course name in Classroom. Teachers can modify this course\n   name if they want- and the change will not be overwritten by the sync.\n\n\nHow are students and teachers matched between Google Workspace and Clever?\n\n * Google Classroom rostering matches users between Clever and Google based on the email field in Clever and emails in Google\n   Workspace. This means that all Classroom users must have the Email field in Clever populated with their Google email in order\n   to utilize this rostering method. Students or teachers that do not exist in Google Workspace will not be associated with\n   Classroom courses. \n\n\nWhat happens if a student or teacher exists in Clever but does not exist in Google Workspace?\n\n * The Google Classroom rostering app will not create, modify, or delete user accounts based on Clever data. Accounts must be\n   created in Google Workspace for Education for them to be rostered to Google Classroom courses. Once an account in Google\n   Workspace is created for the student or teacher, they will be added to their courses.\n\nCan we manage when the Google Classroom roster import application will start syncing and creating courses in Classroom?\n\n * Yes, during the setup you can configure your first sync date. Courses will only be visible to teachers once this first sync is\n   complete.\n\n\nWhat if some of my district’s teachers want to continue manually managing their Classrooms?\n\n * Teachers can reject Clever-created courses and continue manually managing their rosters. Courses created outside Clever will\n   not be modified or deleted by the Clever connection.\n\n \n\nHow can I view manual changes that teachers have made in Google Classroom?\n\n * You can view and track these changes on Google Classroom's audit and investigation page. Instructions can be found here:\n   Classroom log events.\n\n\nDo co-teachers sync with the classroom?\n\n * Yes, you can sync co-teachers with Classroom. Please note that you may only add co-teachers with a Google email address. \n\n\nCan I use sharing rules to control which schools or sections are rostered in Classroom? \n\n * Yes! Clever will provision Classroom courses based on section data that is shared with Google Classroom rostering. You can use\n   sharing rules to prevent certain types of sections from being synced.\n\n\nWill this application share guardian information with Google?\n\n * No, guardian information will not be shared with Google Classroom rostering via this application.\n\n\nCan Clever help me create user accounts in Google Workspace? \n\n * The Google Classroom rostering app does not provision user accounts in Google Workspace. For Identity Management options via\n   Clever, please contact Clever Support.\n\n\nWhat happens if a teacher accidentally declines a Clever-created course? \n\n * Clever-created courses can only be declined if a teacher makes multiple clicks and confirms their intention to decline. If you\n   need to restore a declined course, re-provision the course per the instructions above.\n\n\nIs this connection available to schools with Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals?\n\n * This integration is not available to schools with Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals.\n\n\nIs Google Workspace for Education Plus different from GSuite Enterprise for Education? \n\n * Google Workspace for Education Plus is the rebranded name for G Suite Enterprise for Education. All customers who previously\n   purchased G Suite Enterprise for Education will receive new features and functionality that are released to the new Google\n   Workspace for Education Plus editions.\n\n\nCan students remove themselves from a class? Will they be re-added on the next sync if they do?\n\n * You can adjust unenrollment settings for Google Classroom so students cannot remove themselves from a class. Learn more here.\n\n\nHow often is the sync from Clever to Google Classroom?\n\n * The sync runs on a nightly basis.\n\n\nCan I pause the sync between Clever and Google Classroom?\n\n * Yes! If you need to pause the sync between Clever and Google Classroom, please contact Clever Support with the dates you would\n   like the pause to start and end. This option is intended for semester rollovers when enrollments are still being finalized. \n\n\nWhat happens to courses that are removed from sharing rules?\n\n * If the course has already been accepted or declined by a teacher, there is no effect.\n * If the course has not yet been accepted or declined by the teacher, the course is removed from the list of provisioned courses\n   that the teacher can review.\n * If the course is re-shared in the future, the course will again appear in the list of courses the teacher can either accept or\n   decline"

However, the SSO Profiles configuration has several advantages and may be the right choice\nfor your district.\n\nAdvantages of the SSO Profile configuration:\n\n * Students will be able to use their Clever Badge for all Google sign ins, not just district-managed Chromebooks\n\n * The district can set up different SSO providers for different user groups (e.g. Clever for student Badge users, Entra ID for\n   staff)\n\n * The SSO can be targeted to specific devices so that the Badge prompt is only shown by default on desired devices\n\nIf you'd like to set up Clever the organization-wide SSO in Google, please see this article instead.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP\n\nWHILE THE SETUP IS COMPLEX, CLEVER SUPPORTS UTILIZING GOOGLE’S SSO PROFILES FEATURE FOR CHROMEBOOK LOGIN SETTINGS. PLEASE BE SURE\nTO FOLLOW THE LISTED INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE PROPER CONFIGURATION.\n\n\n\nPART 1: CONFIGURING SSO\n\n 1. Add the Chromebook Login for SSO Profiles application to your Clever district account by navigating to:\n    https://schools.clever.com/applications/add/saml-chromebook-login-for-sso-profiles \n    \n    1. We recommend sharing this application with all users in your district, even if they are not going to use Badges into\n       Chromebooks\n    \n    2. The app will not be visible in user Portals\n    \n    3. Users will not be able to use this app until authorized to do so in Google Admin Console\n\n 2. Go to the Settings tab of the Chromebook for SSO Profiles app and scroll down to “SAML Details”: \n    \n    1. Note the “Identity Provider ACS URL” and “Identity Provider Entity ID” values. You will need these later.\n    \n    2. Click “Download Verification Certificate” to download the certificate file\n       \n\n 3. Log into Google Admin Console and go to the SSO with third party IdP settings page: https://admin.google.com/ac/security/sso \n\n 4. Under the “Third-party SSO profiles” section, click “Add SAML Profile”\n\n 5. In the form, enter the following information:\n    \n    1. SSO profile name: “Clever - Badges” or any name of your choice\n    \n    2. IdP entity ID: paste the “Identity Provider Entity ID” noted in step 2\n    \n    3. Sign-in page URL: paste the “Identity Provider ACS URL” noted in step 2\n       \n       1. If you want to use this feature exclusively with Badges, you can add ?specify_auth=badges to the end of this value. This\n          will make the Clever Badge camera the first screen the user sees upon opening the Chromebook\n          A full Identity Provider ACS URL with the addition will look like this (do not use this example link, instead edit the\n          link you noted in step 2). EXAMPLE:\n          \n          https://samlidp.clever.com/saml-chromebook-login-for-sso-profiles/assert/6639a315ba37b2db1861acc7?specify_auth=badges\n          \n          \n    \n    4. Sign-out page URL: leave blank\n    \n    5. Change password URL: leave blank\n    \n    6. Click Upload Certificate and upload the certificate file downloaded in step 2\n       \n       1. The certificate file downloaded from Clever will be a .crt file. Google’s UI says that the file must be PEM or DER, but\n          .crt will be accepted\n    \n    7. Click Save\n\n 6. On the next page, note the “Entity ID” and “ACS URL” listed under “SP details”. You will need these in the next step.\n\n 7. Back on the application settings page in Clever, scroll down to “SAML Details” and click “Edit” at the bottom of the section.\n    Enter the following information:\n    \n    1. Metadata URL: leave blank\n    \n    2. Assertion Consumer Service URL: paste the “ACS URL” noted in step 6\n    \n    3. Entity ID: paste the “Entity ID” noted in step 6\n       \n       1. Make sure to note the ACS URL and Entity ID are correct! They look very similar, and it is easy to mix them up!\n       \n       2. The ACS URL should include “/acs”\n    \n    4. Attributes: leave set to {{email}}\n       \n       1. If the email field in Clever is not set to your Google email addresses, reach out to Clever Support to update the\n          attribute to the correct field\n    \n    5. Click “Confirm”\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPART 2: CONFIGURING OU TARGETING\n\nThis integration enables precise targeting of the user group who can access the Badges into Chromebooks feature. First, ensure\nthat you have one or more Organizational Units or Groups in Google containing the users and devices that should have access to the\nBadges into Chromebooks feature.\n\n \n\n 1. Return to the SSO with third-party IdP settings page in the Google Admin Console and scroll down to the “Manage SSO profile\n    assignments” section. \n\n 2. Click “Manage” or “Get Started”.\n\n \n\nIf you’ve never set up an SSO assignment, click on GET STARTED\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf you already have SSO assignments set up, click on Manage\n\n\n\n 3. In the sidebar, find the Organizational Unit, Group, or individual users that you want to use this feature. Then, in the main\n    window select “Another SSO profile” and in the dropdown select the Clever profile created in Part 1. We recommended naming it\n    “Clever - Badges”\n\n 4. In the “Select what happens if users go directly to a Google service without first signing in with this SSO profile's\n    third-party IDP” section, you may select either option depending on the user experience that works best for your district:\n\n \n\nHave Google prompt for their username, then redirect them to this profile's IDP sign-in page: Select this option if users should\nalways use Clever to sign in to Google, including sign-ins on browsers and unmanaged devices (Recommended for most deployments)\n\n \n\nRequire users to enter their Google username and password to sign in: Select this if users should only use Clever to sign in to\nGoogle when initially logging in to a managed Chromebook device or if users should have the option to log into managed devices\nwith either Badges or Google credentials. Users will have to use their Google username and password to sign in to Google on\nbrowsers, non-Chromebook devices, and unmanaged Chromebooks.\n\n \n\n 5. Repeat for any other user or device OUs or groups that should use the Badges into Chromebooks experience. For the best user\n    experience, you should target both users AND their devices.\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPART 3: TESTING ON THE WEB (OPTIONAL)\n\nIf you selected the Have Google prompt for their username, then redirect them to this profile's IDP sign-in page setting in step 4\nof the Configure OU targeting section, you can test on the Web without a Chromebook device. If you selected Require users to enter\ntheir Google username and password to sign in, skip this part and proceed to Part 4 Chromebook Settings.\n\n \n\nYou will need:\n\n * A Google user in one of the targeted OUs\n\n * A Clever account whose email matches the Google user\n\n * A Badge for this Clever account\n\n \n\nIn an Incognito or Private browser window, go to https://accounts.google.com and enter the email address for the Google user\naccount. You should be redirected to Clever to sign-in.\n\n \n\nFollow the Clever prompts to scan your Badge. You should be authenticated with Clever and then signed in to the Google account.\n\n \n\nNote that it may take some time for Clever and Google to each process their various authorizations to allow your user(s) to use\nSSO. If the login doesn’t work the first time, try again in a few minutes. If it still isn’t working, please review the steps\nabove or contact support.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPART 4: ADDITIONAL GOOGLE SETTINGS\n\n \n\nUpdate your Google user and device settings to enable:\n\n * Clever to access the device camera on the login screen\n\n * Re-prompt for a Badge after the device is reopened after being closed\n\n * Sign the user into Clever automatically when they sign in to the device\n\n \n\n 1. Navigate to Devices > Chrome > Settings > Users & browsers and scroll down to the Security section\n\n 2. Set Lock Screen settings to: \"Do not allow locking screen\"\n    \n\n 3. Scroll a little bit until you reach the Single sign-on and SAML single sign-on login frequency settings in the Security\n    section.\n    \n    1. Set Single sign-on to \"Enable SAML-based single sign on for Chrome devices\".\n       \n    \n    2. Set SAML single sign-on login frequency to an appropriate duration. We recommend \"Every 2 weeks\" for the best experience.\n       \n\n 4. Scroll to the Power and Shutdown section. Set the following Idle settings\n\n * Set Action on lid close to \"Logout\"\n\n * Set Lock screen on sleep to \"Don't lock screen\"\n\n * Set AC idle action to \"Logout\"\n\n * Set Battery idle action to “Logout”\n\n\n\n 5. Next, scroll down to the Startup section further down on the same page\n    \n    1. Change the Homepage configuration to Homepage is always the URL set below. Set your Homepage URL to your Clever Portal URL.\n       You can find your Clever Portal URL here.\n       \n\n 6. Click the Device settings tab at the top of the settings panel and scroll down to Sign-in settings\n    \n\n 7. Set Guest Mode to \"Disable guest mode\"\n    \n\n 8. Set Sign-in Screen to \"Never show user names and photos\"\n\n\n\n 9.  Set Single Sign-On IdP Redirection to \"Allow users to go directly to SAML SSO IdP page\"\n     \n\n 10. Set Single Sign-On Cookie Behavior to \"Enable transfer of SAML SSO Cookies into user session\"\n     \n\n 11. Enter https://clever.com/oauth/badges/login under Single sign-on camera permissions. These settings ensure that Clever has\n     access to your Chromebooks' cameras to validate Clever Badge logins\n     \n\n 12. Scroll down to Kiosk Settings and ensure that Managed guest session is set to \"Do not allow managed guest sessions\"\n     \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPART 5: TESTING ON CHROMEBOOK\n\nYou will need:\n\n * A Google user in one of the targeted OUs\n\n * A Chromebook device from a targeted OU\n\n * A Clever student account whose email matches the Google user\n\n * A Badge for this Clever student account\n\nTo test the login:\n\n 1. Power on the device.\n 2. When prompted, present the Badge.\n 3. You should now be authenticated and logged into ChromeOS.\n\nIf you do not see the Clever login screen, double-check your OU targeting from Part 2.\n\nIf everything seems correct and you still do not see the Clever login screen, restart the device. The device must be connected to\nthe Internet, and SSO settings may take some time to apply. Depending on your configuration, you may need to first enter the\nGoogle email address of a user in the SSO target OU. \n\nIf you’re still not seeing a Clever login screen, please contact Clever Support.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\nBadge scan looping or not logging in\n\nUsers may experience issues logging in when SSO is enabled and the “Require password change” is set to ON on the Security tab of\ntheir user account in the Google Admin Console. This is due to an issue in how Google is handling this situation - they are\nwaiting for a password change that never happens since the user utilizes SSO to sign-in. To workaround this, disable “Require\npassword change” for any SSO users.\n\n \n\nMultiple SSO Profiles\n\nIf you have multiple SSO profiles in your district (e.g. Clever and ADFS) then you should set the “Domain-specific service URLs”\nsetting to “Require users to enter their username on Google’s sign-in page first”. Any other setting could cause issues for users\nsigning in with certain SSO profiles. \n\n \n\niPad and iPhone\n\nUsers may encounter unexpected behavior when the Have Google prompt for their username, then redirect them to this profile's IdP\nsign-in page setting is enabled and they are signing in to a native iOS application using Google on an iPad or iPhone with the\nClever app installed. The initial login attempt will fail to redirect them to their target application and they will have to retry\nthe login a second time. If users frequently sign in to iOS applications with Google on shared iPads, you may want to consider\nswitching this setting to Require users to enter their Google username and password to sign in.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat is the best way to use Google applications (Docs, Sheets, Drive, etc.) through Clever?\n\n * If you set up Clever as an IdP for Google, please see our article Adding Google SSO applications to provide the best login\n   experience for all Google applications (drive, docs, sheets, etc.).\n\nWhat are the advantages of using Clever as an SSO Profile instead of the organization-wide SSO provider?\n\n * Students will be able to use their Clever Badge for all Google sign ins, not just district-managed Chromebooks\n\n * The district can set up different SSO providers for different user groups (e.g. Clever for student Badge users, Entra ID for\n   staff)\n\n * The SSO can be targeted to specific devices so that the Badge prompt is only shown by default on desired devices\n\nWhy would I set up Clever as the organization-wide SSO Provider instead of an SSO Profile?\n\n * Setting up Clever as the organization-wide SSO Provider is the standard configuration for setting up Chromebook logins. This\n   setup is significantly easier since there are fewer settings to apply, and is recommended for admins less familiar with the\n   Google Admin Console.

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. What is SAML?\n3. How SAML works\n4. How you can use SAML with Clever\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will give you an overview of what SAML is and how to use it. By the way, SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup\nLanguage, in case you were wondering!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS SAML?\n\nSo technically, SAML is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between two parties. It’s commonly\nused for single sign-on (SSO), allowing users to sign in once and authenticate securely with multiple third-party applications.\nSAML is one of the methods Clever uses to help you access a variety of connected applications just by signing in to Clever!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW SAML WORKS\n\nTwo primary roles in a SAML exchange are Service Providers (SP) and Identity Providers (IdP).\n\n * Service Providers: SPs are services or applications (like BrainPOP or Remind) that users want to access. Service Providers\n   coordinate with Identity Providers to authorize and grant access to those services or apps.\n * Identity Providers: IdPs (like Active Directory or Google) authenticate the user (making sure you’re you!) and share\n   authorization information with SPs. Identity Providers package the users' information into a well-known format known as a SAML\n   Assertion.\n\nThe thing to know about SAML is that both SPs or IdPs can kick off the sign-in process into an app; it just depends on where you,\nas the user, visit first:\n\n * If you visit the application first, the application (or SP in SAML terms) will ask the Identity Provider for information about\n   the user and then use that information to process the login, essentially asking the Identity Provider if you’re legit.\n * If you first visit an SSO application (or IdP like the Clever Portal) and then navigate to an application from a list of\n   approved applications, the IdP will forward information to the Service Provider, giving them a heads up that you’re who you say\n   you are.\n\nTo illustrate this, let’s look at the following scenario:\nYou’re attending the Educators of the Year conference (yay, you!). When you arrive, you need to pick up your attendance badge and\na color-coded lanyard to allow you into specific sessions at the conference. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nYou can get your badge and lanyard in one of two ways.\n\nOption 1: Check in, then go to the venue for your session (like going through an IdP and then a Service Provider/app)\n\nChecking in to the event involves contacting the event coordinators, who then verify registration and put together a packet with\nyour badge and lanyard. \n\nOption 2: Head to the venue and get checked in (like going to the Service Provider/app, and having it verify you via an IdP)\n\nAlternatively, you can check in at the venue, which then contacts the event coordinators who verify your registration.\n\nRegardless of the check-in method, the result remains the same- your registration is verified, and you have the necessary badge\nand lanyard to participate in the sessions.\nIn this scenario, the event coordinator acts as the Identity Provider while the venue acts as the Service Provider. The packet put\ntogether by the event coordinator is similar to the SAML assertion. You have two options for checking in. The first method, early\ncheck-in, is similar to the IdP-initiated flow. The second method, checking in at the venue, is similar to the SP-initiated flow.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW YOU CAN USE SAML WITH CLEVER\n\nYou can add any SAML connection as an IdP into Clever! We offer support for Active Directory Federation Services  (AD and Entra\nID), Okta, and Rapid ID. However, any SAML connection can be created by following the same steps outlined in this article. Clever\nwon’t have insight into the IdP other than those we offer support for.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\n * Single sign-on (SSO): Configure a SAML-based IDP for access to Clever\n * For Clever Admins: MFA+ SAML application setup guide\n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

User clicked on app, and Clever asked for a username and password\n4. Data incorrect in apps\n5. Problems within apps\n\nPlease note: It's important to distinguish between an issue logging into Clever (a user can't access Clever) and an issue\naccessing an application from within the Clever portal (e.g after the user has successfully logged into Clever). If a user can't\naccess Clever, that is a separate troubleshooting issue from what we cover here. Please see this article to help troubleshoot\nusers' access to Clever: Troubleshooting: Tools - Login Logs.\n\nFor more information about what team you should contact for support, we have a great video resource that can provide more insight:\nGetting support for district admin.\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOccasionally users run into issues with their applications. This can be due to a user not being shared with an app to errors\noccurring within the application (which would need to be addressed by the application's support team). This article will go over\nsome of the common issues and guide you on how to troubleshoot. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAPP IS MISSING\n\nIf a user is missing an app in the Clever Portal, please confirm the user is shared with the application. The most common reasons\na user is not shared with an app are:\n\n 1. The user does not have any sections in Clever.\n 2. The user does not meet the filter criteria for sharing rules (usually section grade level or subject)\n\nIn both cases, you will want to confirm they are enrolled in sections in your student information system (SIS) and that the data\nis synced to Clever. Alternatively, you may need to adjust the sharing permissions for the application to ensure the user is\nshared. You can learn about sharing permissions here: Sharing Permissions: Overview.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUSER CLICKED ON APP, AND RECEIVED AN ERROR\n\nClever has an excellent tool for debugging this scenario. Please see this article for information on using the \"Troubleshoot\nLogin\" tool. \n\nIn general, if a user clicks on an application in the Clever Portal and receives an error on the application's page, please reach\nout to the application's support team for help. Most login issues must be resolved by the application's support team.\n \n\nClever Tip: If they are seeing an error at a web URL that is not a Clever address, it's likely that the application's team is best\nequipped to help fix the issue. Please reach out to the application's support team to investigate further!\n\n\nHere are examples of common errors you might see for specific applications:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLICKED ON APP, CLEVER ASKED FOR A USERNAME AND PASSWORD\n\nIf a Clever page asks a user to enter their username and password for an application, enter the correct login information for that\napplication, and click Save Login. If the device has the Clever browser extension downloaded, Clever will save this information\nand automatically log the student in next time they click the icon from the Portal!\n\n\n \n\nIf a user clicks on an application and sees the page below, this means we were not able to log in the user with the username and\npassword they provided. Please have them enter their correct username and password for the application, and click 'Update & Log\nin'.\n \n\n\n \n\nIf they are still having trouble, please confirm that the username and password they entered will allow them to successfully log\ninto their account directly on the application's page (i.e. at schoology.com). If you can access the app directly through the\napp's website but not through Clever, please contact Clever Support for help!\n \n\nDid you know? Applications that prompt users to manually enter credentials as shown above are called SSO (Saved Passwords)\napplications. Learn more about these applications in this Help Center article: For Teachers: What are Saved Passwords\napplications?   \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nDATA INCORRECT IN APPS\n\nIf the data in an application is incorrect (e.g. rosters, students, and school associations), please see this article. \n \n\nPlease note: Most applications sync with Clever daily. Please allow up to 24 hrs for newly updated or shared data in Clever to be\nreflected in your connected applications.  For more information, visit: How often will my applications sync with Clever?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  \n\n\nPROBLEMS WITHIN APPLICATIONS\n\nAfter a user clicks on an application from the Clever Portal, their experience within the app is controlled by that app. Clever\ndoes not have any insight into the inner workings of an application.  A good analogy would be to think of Clever as the key to\nopening the door to the application, but once that door is open, we do not go inside. If a user is running into an issue within\nthe application, please contact the application’s support team for help.\n\nHere are common examples of when an application’s team will be best equipped to provide support:\n\n * You are receiving an error message on the application’s website\n * You are seeing incorrect data within the application, but correct data within the Clever\n * You are having trouble accessing grades, homework, textbooks, videos, resources, or running reports within the application\n * Your sections have access to the incorrect content within the application\n * You have questions about features within the application\n * The application does not save a student’s progress\n * The application is frozen\n * The application logs or kicks you or your students out\n * You need to merge or match an old or preexisting account with the one created through Clever"

But my issue doesn't look like that!\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nEvery now and then you may have users who have trouble logging into Saved Passwords applications, or they need to update their\ncredentials for the app. Here are some tips for troubleshooting these issues which will make the process as painless as possible.\n\nIf your current district settings for the Saved Passwords application allow your users to manually enter their credentials the\nvery first time they log into the app through Clever, Clever will save those credentials for the future providing a single sign-on\n(SSO) experience for users. \n\nThe challenge is that sometimes users will enter the incorrect credentials the first time around, and those are what gets saved to\nClever. The great news is that those credentials can be updated in Clever!\n \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, if users are unable to log into a Saved Passwords application, they'll see a message like the one\nbelow:\n\n\n\n\nUPDATING STUDENT CREDENTIALS\n\nTo update a student's credentials, please follow these steps:\n\n 1. Go directly to the application's website login page outside of Clever, and confirm if the user's credentials are successful.\n    * If the credentials are not successful, please contact the application provider directly to correct the error.\n    * If credentials are successful, attempt to enter those same credentials again in the screen shown above and then select\n      'Update & Log in'. Then, confirm the credentials work by accessing the application again through the Clever Portal.\n\nIf for some reason, the 'Update & Log in' option in the screenshot above did not work with resetting the user's credentials, the\nstudent's teacher or a district admin can assist by following these steps:\n \n\n * The teacher will log in to Clever.  District admins can utilize the 'Access Portal As' feature from their Clever Dashboard to\n   access the teacher's account in order to do the following:\n   * Click on the 'Help a Student' option.\n   * Locate the student who needs their credentials updated. \n   * The prompt will ask if you want to update the student's Clever login or generate a backup code. Click 'No' where it asks if\n     this solved the problem. \n\n\n * Locate the Saved Passwords application.\n * When asked if the student has the app icon in their portal, say 'Yes.'\n * Then update the Saved Passwords credentials. \n\n\n\n             \n\n * Finally, have the student test their login to the app to see if it works correctly (or district admins can 'Access Portal As'\n   the student to test it for them).\n\nDistrict admins can also set credentials for Saved Passwords apps through a bulk upload in the Clever Dashboard.\n\n\n\nUPDATING STAFF & TEACHER CREDENTIALS\n\nIf a staff member or teacher inputs incorrect credentials for an SSO (Saved Passwords) application, they can update them by\nfollowing these steps:\n\n 1. Log in to the Clever Portal.\n 2. Select the application that has incorrect credentials.\n 3. Enter the correct username and password for the application, and click 'Update & Log in'.\n\nIf for some reason the above steps do not work, please reach out to Clever Support for assistance.\n\nClever Tip: If you are still having trouble, please confirm that the username and password you've entered work to log into your\naccount directly on the application's page. If you can successfully access the app directly through their website, but not through\nClever, please reach out to Clever Support for help!\n\n\n\nBUT MY ISSUE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT!\n\nIf the above doesn't fix the issue or you're experiencing a completely different problem, please try the following steps:\n\n 1.

Adding Custom School District Icons \n\n \n\n\nGetting started with Clever Portal? Check out our course Quick Start - Setting up your Portal  available in Clever Academy! \n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFrom an admin perspective, there are two primary components in Clever. The Clever Dashboard is the landing page for Clever Admins\nwhen logging in to Clever. Your district's Clever Portal is accessible from the top right of the Clever Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n * Clever Dashboard: This is where Clever Admins configure district settings, review data analytics, locate various users or\n   records, troubleshoot issues, and more! There is also a universal search bar at the top of the Dashboard that allows Clever\n   Admins to search for various users, schools, applications, or sections.\n * Clever Portal: This is where Clever Admins can design, organize, and structure their district's Clever Portal by creating\n   categories, and adding links to various applications and websites, which will make it easier for district users to navigate\n   their individual Clever Portals. Clever Portal will be highlighted in this article.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n To learn more about navigating the Clever Dashboard, please visit: For District Admins: How do I use the Clever Dashboard?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nACCESSING YOUR CLEVER PORTAL\n\nTo access the district's Clever Portal, Clever Admins or School Tech Leads (STLs) will begin by logging into to Clever Dashboard >\nSSO & Portal > Customize Portal.\n\n\n\n Please note: Clever Admins are only able to edit the district Portal, not individual school's Portals. Only School Tech Leads can\nedit individual school Portals. For more information please see our article Clever Portal: Customizing the Clever Portal - School\nTech Leads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDING & EDITING CATEGORIES\n\nFrom your Clever Portal, Clever Admins can create custom categories to group applications, making it easier for district users to\nlocate the applications they need (e.g., elementary, middle, or high school application categories). To do this, please:\n\n * First, select the Customize Portal option at the top right of Clever Portal.\n * Select Add a new category or select the existing category title you would like to modify to update the name.\n * To delete a category, please select the Remove Category option corresponding to the category you wish to remove.\n * Select Publish Changes after you are finished!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDING CUSTOM EXTERNAL LINKS\n\nCustom external link applications are links that lead users to application login pages, but users are not logged in automatically.\nAn example might be setting up a link that leads to your district's Learning Management System (LMS) or student information system\n(SIS). If these programs are not currently integrated with Clever, users would need to manually enter their login credentials.\nHowever, Clever Admins can still create various application icons in Clever Portal that will display in district users' portals\nand lead them to the login pages for each respective program or application. To add custom external link:\n\n * First, select the Customize Portal option at the top right of your Clever Portal.\n * Select Add Link next to the category under which you want the new link to appear.\n * Select the last option in the menu to Create a custom link.\n * Select a generic icon or upload a custom icon.\n   * To upload a custom icon, select Upload to search for the appropriate image from your desktop. Images must be in the .png file\n     format, and less than 2MB. The optimal icon size is 200 x 200 pixels.\n * Enter the requested information into the appropriate fields.\n * Select which user types, grades, and schools you would like to have access to this custom link.\n * Select Add Link.\n * Select Publish Changes from the top right of the page when you are finished.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMOVING ICONS\n\nTo help organize your district's resources to make it easy for students and teachers to find what they need, you can relocate or\nmove application icons to different categories in your Clever Portal. To do so, follow the steps below:\n\n * First, select the Customize Portal option at the top right of your Clever Portal.\n * Drag and drop icons to the preferred categories.  \n * Select Publish Changes to the top right of the page once you are finished making updates.\n\n \n\n\nClever Tip: If you are experiencing issues dragging and dropping the application icons, please try adjusting your browser zoom\nsettings to a smaller size and try again!\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING CUSTOM SCHOOL DISTRICT ICONS\n\nNow Clever admin can upload a custom icon to your school district’s Clever Portal. Having a custom icon helps users quickly\nidentify that they are logging into the correct portal. \n\nYou can set your school district icon by going to Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Portal settings > Customization tab. Then,\nupload your district icon. These are the required image specs:\n\n * Upload your icon in .png format only\n * Maximum image size is 200px by 200px\n * Can be color or black & white\n * Should be high-quality, non-blurry, or distorted\n * For best results, upload a square image\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have uploaded the icon, click Update. Now users will be able to view the icon on your school district’s login page.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * For District Admins: How do I use the Clever Dashboard?\n * For District Admins: Clever Portal - Adding External Links (Hyperlinks)\n * For District Admin: Clever Academy Course Catalog - Learn more about Clever!"

Hiding resources in the Portal for Clever Admins and School Tech Leads\n5. How do hidden applications appear in Clever Portal\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article is an overview of the various methods for preventing logins and hiding applications in Clever. There are many reasons\na district may wish to hide applications in a Clever Portal from scheduling a launch to hiding resources during testing periods.\nClever's visibility settings allow districts to manage application access with ease.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHIDING APPS VS DISABLING LOGINS\n\nThere are several options for Clever Admins and teachers to hide or limit access to applications through Clever. \n\nIf you only want to hide the application from the Portal but don’t want to prevent logins to Clever, adjust your App Visibility\nSettings. If you’re looking to block user access to Clever altogether, use Access Control.\n\nTo better understand this, we have created a table that provides insight into these options.\n\nPlease note that none of the features listed in the table below will block direct access to apps rostered through Clever (e.g.\nusers can still log into the app at the app's website outside of Clever if the application supports this).\n\n \n\n\nFEATURE\n\n\nACCESS CONTROL\n\n \n\n\nAPP VISIBILITY SETTINGS\n\n\nHIDING IN PORTAL\n\n\nTEACHER PAGE CATEGORY HIDING\n\nAbout the feature\n\nClever Admins can temporarily block Clever Portal access so that users can’t access Clever and their applications through Clever.\n\nClever Admins can hide specific applications in Clever and prevent users from using Log in with Clever (LIWC) buttons. The app\nwill show up as disabled on Teacher Pages.\n\nClever Admins and School Tech Leads (if enabled) can hide specific apps and links on the District Page, but applications that are\non Teacher Pages are still visible and can be used.\n\nTeachers can enable this to hide categories and resources within the category on a Teacher Page.  This doesn’t affect visibility\noutside of the specific category on that Teacher Page.\n\nWho can configure\n\nClever Admins\n\nClever Admins\n\nClever Admins/School Tech Leads (STLs)\n\nTeachers\n\nStaff/Teacher/Student Portal Experience\n\nSpecified user types can't log into Clever or use Login with Clever (LIWC) buttons\n\nSpecified user types can't log into Specific App or use LIWC buttons to access Specific App\n\nSpecified user types can't see the app in the Portal resource list or District Page (but can still see, use, and add on Teacher\nPages)\n\nStudents will not be able to see the hidden category on a Teacher Page\n\nIs the app visible in the Clever Portal?\n\nNo - there is no access to the Portal\n\nNo - the app isn't visible in Portal and shows up as disabled in Teacher Pages\n\nNot in the resources list or District Page but is visible on Teacher Pages and the Clever Admin Portal\n\nThis feature doesn't affect visibility outside of the specific category on that  Teacher Page\n\nDoes it block all Clever-Powered SSO (LIWC)?\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nError Message\n\n  \n\n    \n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nStaff/Teacher/Student SSO Experience\n\nSee error above if users try to log into Clever or use the LIWC button\n\nSee error above if users try to log in using the LIWC button\n\nNot visible in resource list or district page - LIWC works to log in\n\nCategory and category's resources not visible for students\n\nCan it be set for specific dates?\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWhich users can this be applied to?\n\nStaff, Teachers, Students - set by user type\n\nStaff, Teachers, Students - set by user type\n\nStaff, Teachers, Students - set by user type\n\nStudents\n\nDoes it hide the app everywhere?\n\nYes - no access to the Portal\n\nYes\n\nNo - hides the Portal link - apps on Teacher Pages will still be visible\n\nNo\n\nDoes it work for links?\n\nYes - no access to the Portal\n\nNo - only apps\n\nYes - can be used for apps or links\n\nYes - it hides all resources in that category while on that specific Teacher Page\n\nHelp Center Articles\n\nTemporarily disable Clever logins using Access Control\n\nClever Portal: Hiding Applications\nClever Portal: Disable logins to applications\n\nClever Portal: Hiding Applications\n\nClever Portal: Teacher Pages\n\nRecommended Uses\n\nBlock user access during pre-school-year rollover to prevent early visibility of schedules/assignments\n\nBlock Clever-powered access to apps\n\n * For links\n * Usable by STLs\n * When you want teachers to be able to add apps to Teacher Pages but don't want an app visible on general Portal \n\nFor teachers to hide resources they are not currently using on their Teacher Pages\n\n \n\n\n\nHIDING SSO OR SSO (SAVED PASSWORDS) APPLICATIONS\n\n\nStep 1: Log in to the Clever Dashboard and navigate to Clever Dashboard > My applications and click the app you'd like to hide.\nThis will disable the application for the selected users.\n\nStep 2: Go to the Settings tab and click Edit in the Application’s visibility box\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Select the user type you wish to hide the application from.

You will have the option to\nselect unique Start and End Dates for each user type.\n\n \n\nIn the example below, Teachers need access to the application on March 5th for training, however students will not be using the\napplication until March 12th. With Clever's visibility tool, you can fully control the rollout of applications for all users.\n\n\n \n\nStep 7: When complete, select Hide application\n\nStep 8: Finally, click Publish Changes to save your updates\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO HIDDEN APPLICATIONS APPEAR IN CLEVER PORTAL?\n\nWhen hiding is enabled, the application icon will display in the Clever Admin Portal with a banner that indicates it is hidden\nfrom users. In the user's Clever Portal, the application icon will be fully hidden until the End Date is reached.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Temporarily disable Clever logins using Access Control\n * Clever Portal: Hiding Applications\n * Clever Portal: Disable logins to applications\n * Clever Portal: Teacher Pages"

From your Clever Portal > Pages, you'll see three\noptions: \n\n * My Teacher Pages, which house:\n   * Your Teacher Pages! All teachers start with two Teacher Pages:\n     * One that is private and not visible to students, which can house various resources that are not student-facing.\n     * One that is scoped to students. Page visibility can be modified to include students in just one class, multiple classes,\n       all students, and so on! You can make more pages (more on that below).\n   * Any resources you’ve favorited by hovering on the icon and clicking the heart.\n   * All resources you’ve added to Clever via your Teacher Pages (such as Clever Library apps, links, and PDFs).\n * District Page, which houses any apps, programs, and links your district has shared with you.\n * Shared with Me Pages, which houses any Teacher Pages that other teachers at your school have shared with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCREATING A NEW TEACHER PAGE\n\n * In the Clever Portal, click the Pages tab from the left-hand side menu and select My Teacher Pages from the drop-down\n * Click Add in the top right-hand corner\n\n\n\n * Edit the page title, add a description, add class resources, and personalize your icon.\n\n\n\n * Design your Teacher Page by adding your desired resources, categories, and content.\n * Once you're ready to publish your page to make it visible to students, click More page actions > Share at the top of your page,\n   then select the classe(s) you’d like to share the page with.\n   \n   \n\n * Click Update.\n\n          \n\n  Teacher Login Tools will become available to teachers once they have shared their Teacher Page with students.

They can\ndownload or print the PDF using the tools in the top-right corner: \n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nORGANIZING TEACHER PAGES\n\nTo keep your Teacher Page neat and easy for students to navigate, you can organize resources into different categories. Categories\nprovide a way to separate your resources by unit, topic, etc. Please note:\n\n * Create new categories by clicking the Add button in the top right of your Teacher Page and then selecting Category.\n * Categories can be reordered or deleted by using the arrow and trash icons next to the category name.\n   Resources can be reorganized by dragging and dropping them into the appropriate categories.\n * If you have a category that you don’t want students to see just yet (such as your next unit of study that’s starting in a few\n   weeks), you can hide the category by clicking the eye icon in the top right of the category!\n * When you’re ready for the category to be visible, click on the eye icon again. If a student is already on your page when you\n   hide/unhide a category, they’ll need to refresh the page to see the change.\n\n \n \n\nModifying links and resources\n\nDeleting content\nLinks and resources can be deleted from Teacher Pages by following these instructions:\n\n 1. From your Teacher Page, hover over the resource or link you'd like to remove and click the three vertical dots (⋮). \n 2. In the menu that opens, click Remove\n\nCopying content to another page\nYou can also copy any link or resource to another Teacher Page that you've created:\n\n 1. From your Teacher Page, hover over the resource or link you'd like to remove and click the three vertical dots (⋮). \n 2. In the menu that opens, click Edit and choose the page to which you want to add the resource at the bottom of the pop-up.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSHARING WITH STUDENTS AND THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE\n\nOnce you've created a Teacher Page, be sure to preview what it looks like for students by clicking More page actions > Preview\nPage at the top of your Teacher Page. \n\n\n\nAfter confirming it looks great, you can share it with students by following these steps:\n\n * Click Share at the top of your Teacher Page, and select the appropriate student access. \n * Click Save.\n\nYou can remove student access anytime by returning to the Share button. \n\nWhen students log into Clever, they’ll see an icon in their Portal for each Teacher Page that has been shared with them:\n\n\n\n\nWhen students click on your Teacher Page icon, they’ll be directed to your page and can access all associated resources.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSHARING RESOURCES WITH OTHER TEACHERS AND VIEWING SHARED RESOURCES\n\nYou can share your Teacher Pages and individual resources with teachers in your school and view others’ resources when they share\nthem with you. Learn more here!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDELETING TEACHER PAGES\n\nClever requires at least one Teacher Page per teacher account. If you determine you don’t want students to access a page, you can\nmodify the student sharing, so the page is only visible to you.\n\nIf you have multiple Teacher Pages and would like to delete one of them, navigate to your My Teachers Pages tab, then click\nDelete.\n\nPlease know that there is no way to undo deleting a Page. If you have a page you might want to use in the future, we recommend\nunsharing it with students and keeping it for future use.\n \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTRANSITIONING TO A NEW SCHOOL YEAR \n\nGreat news: Teacher Pages are preserved across academic years! You don't need to recreate Teacher Pages for your students.\n\nWhen your school transitions to a new school year in Clever, our system automatically updates any Teacher Pages shared with\nspecific sections to Just me sharing. This excludes Just Me and All sections pages.\n\nThis update ensures that Teacher Pages are consciously shared with your students. As such, students won't see a section-specific\nTeacher Page until you decide to share it with them.\n\nAs a teacher, you’ll see an Attention Needed message for any Teacher Page that’s affected. When you click on the Teacher Page,\nyou’ll be guided through re-sharing it with students for the new academic year.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nNew School Year\nIf your students can't see your Teacher Page, you may need to reshare the page at the start of the new school year. See:\nTransitioning to a new school year\n\nNew Teacher_ID (SIS_ID)\nIf you can't see your Teacher Pages, please check with your school to see if your teacher ID has changed. If it has, you won't be\nable to access your previous Teacher Pages. If your district can revert your teacher ID to its previous value, your Teacher Pages\nwill be restored. If your district cannot revert your teacher ID to its previous value, Clever cannot restore the Teacher Pages.\nIf you are unsure why a user's teacher_id has changed, please contact your SIS provider. Clever is unable to troubleshoot why a\nteacher_id value may have changed in the data being synced to Clever."

FAQs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAccess control allows district admins to determine when students, teachers, and staff can access the Clever Portal and apps via\nClever. Access control is intended as a temporary measure to limit potential student, teacher, or staff access to course-related\ninformation during sensitive time periods.\n\nWhen logging in to the Clever Portal or some connected applications, students, teachers, and staff are able to infer some\ninformation about which students and teachers are assigned to which classes (such as if they log into a reading app via Clever and\nsee that they’re listed under 5th Period ELA with Ms. Thompson).\n\nBy using access control, district admins can prevent students, teachers, and staff from viewing course-related information in\nClever Portal or their connected applications by disabling login access.\n\nPlease note: Users may still be able to log into third-party applications if the applications support login methods other than\nClever. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP ACCESS CONTROL\n\nYou can set up access control by following these steps:\n\n 1. From your Clever Dashboard navigate to SSO & Portal > SSO settings page.\n 2. Go to the Access control tab and click Edit.\n     \n    \n    \n    \n 3. Select the user type(s) you wish to disable access for.\n 4. Select the Start and End Dates for disabling access.\n     \n    \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nUPDATING ACCESS CONTROL\n\nYou can return to the access control options to edit Start and End Dates at any time. You can also immediately restore access by\nclicking Enabled next to the relevant user type.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nUSER EXPERIENCE \n\nAny user that tries to log into Clever or an application via Clever while their access is disabled will see the screen below,\nwhich will inform them that their access has been disabled and the date on which it will be restored:\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat type of information can users infer?\n\n * Students\n   * Teachers by viewing teacher pages and apps they will use in their upcoming courses via Clever\n   * Teachers and classmates in some connected apps\n * Teachers\n   * Class and student associations from viewing sections and apps via Clever\n   * Class and student associations from viewing sections in connected apps\n * Staff\n   * Duties based on available apps\n\nShould we enable Access Control?\n\n * You can see what students, teachers, and staff see in their Portals using the Access Portal as user feature. Decide based on\n   what a typical Portal looks like whether you want to disable login access using access control.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWill this prevent students from accessing applications via login methods other than Clever?\n\n * Access control will only block your students from logging into the Clever Portal and using Clever SSO to log into other\n   applications (e.g. through Log in with Clever buttons). Access Control cannot prevent users from logging into applications via\n   other methods.\n * If you want to block non-Clever login pathways to an application, we recommend reaching out to that application to discuss\n   options with them directly.\n   \n\nHow is this different from the hiding applications feature?\n\n * Clever admin have the ability to hide applications and links in Clever. There are differences between hiding apps and access\n   control:\n   * The hide feature:\n     * Only applies to individual applications and links – it can’t be applied to multiple resources at the same time. \n     * Doesn't control users’ access to the Clever Portal. Users can still log in to the Clever Portal and see various features\n       like Teacher Pages and Messaging.\n   * Access control:\n     * Allows administrators to disable access to all Clever applications at once.\n     * Prevents selected user types from logging into the Clever Portal.\n       \n\nWhen exactly will users be able to start logging in on disable end date?\n\n * Users will be able to start logging in at midnight local time on the selected disable end date.\n   \n\nWhat should I do if I want to enable access before my scheduled end date?\n\n * From your Clever Dashboard, navigate to SSO & Portal > SSO settings page > Access control tab, select Edit, and change the\n   disable end date to whatever new date you want to use. If you select the current day, users will gain access immediately."

Clicking the Clever browser extension\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Clever browser extension is the key to ensuring that SSO (Saved Passwords) applications function properly because it\nfacilitates the secure storing of user login credentials for these types of applications. In addition, the extension provides\nusers with a seamless single sign-on (SSO) experience to these applications through Clever. If the Clever extension is not present\non a device, the user will need to manually enter their login credentials when accessing SSO (Saved Passwords) applications\nthrough Clever.\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) is available for integrated applications in Clever without the browser extension. To find out which type an\napplication is, Clever Admins can navigate to their list of applications from the Clever Dashboard > Home page to locate the\napplication and look under the App Type column. \n\n\nFor more about the different types of applications in Clever, please visit: For District Admins: Apps - Types of apps\n\nClever supports the following internet browsers:\n\n * Chrome\n * Firefox\n * Microsoft Edge\n * Apple Safari (we support this browser for general use with Clever, but not for SSO (Save Passwords) apps, as we do not\n   currently offer a Safari Extension) \n\nThe Clever browser extension is not required for iOS devices (e.g., iPads, iPhones) as these devices use the Clever app, which\nacts as the browser extension. For details, visit: SSO (Saved Passwords) Apps: iOS Devices\n\nFor devices where the browser extension cannot be downloaded (e.g., Android, Amazon Fire tablets, Safari), users will need to\nmanually enter their login credentials for SSO (Saved Passwords) applications when accessing them through Clever. For additional\ndetails, visit: Clever Technical Requirements & Supported Devices\n\nIt is expected that when a user clicks on the Chrome Extension, it will take them to clever.com/login.\n\nTo streamline your login flow suggest directing your students and teachers to use your district’s portal URL which can be found in\nthe District Admin Clever Dashboard here: https://schools.clever.com/portal/settings\n\n \n\nPlease note:  If users are accessing SSO (Saved Passwords) applications from home due to remote learning, we recommend\nstandardizing credentials for SSO (Saved Passwords) applications (e.g., student number as the required username and date of birth\nas the password). Doing this will make it easier for students and families to remember their login credentials when logging in to\nthese types of applications.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER BROWSER EXTENSION INSTALLATION & DIRECTIONS\n\nPlease see the links below for information and instructions for installing the Clever browser extension:\n\n * Google Chrome:  Install  |  Directions\n * Microsoft Edge (New):   Install  |  Directions\n * Firefox: Install | Directions\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPUSHING OUT THE CLEVER BROWSER EXTENSION TO ALL DISTRICT USERS\n\nPlease see the following articles for details on pushing out the Clever browser extension to all district users:\n\n * Chrome extension instructions\n * Microsoft Edge\n * Mozilla Firefox extension instructions\n\nClever Tip: If you are experiencing difficulty deploying or pushing out the Clever browser extension to your users, or need\nfurther instruction, please contact the browser provider's support team directly. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLICKING THE CLEVER BROWSER EXTENSION\n\nThe primary function of the Clever browser extension is to facilitate logins for SSO (Saved Passwords) applications.\n\nWhen the extension is clicked, the following actions will occur based on the user's browser state:\n\n * When already logged into the Portal in another tab, clicking the extension will take the user to their Portal\n * When logged out, but using a browser where the user has logged into the Clever Portal before, clicking the extension will take\n   the user to the district Clever Portal login URL\n * When in an incognito window, new browser, or after clearing browser history, a click will take the user to the Clever school\n   selection screen\n\nTo streamline your login flow and provide a consistent experience, we suggest directing your students and teachers to use your\ndistrict’s Portal URL, which can be found at Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Portal settings > URL.\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Clever Technical Requirements & Supported Devices\n * SSO (Saved Passwords) Apps: iOS Devices\n * For District Admins: Apps - Types of apps"

Click Next, choose your students.\n 6. Choose the class(es) or individual student(s) you want the Kahoot to launch for. Once you've selected your desired settings,\n    click Continue. \n 7. Make sure all your students have their Clever Portal open on their device. Once all students are logged in, click Launch\n    Kahoot.\n 8. Kahoot! will open for the students you shared within their existing (Clever) browser tab. You'll see a notification on your\n    screen confirming that the Kahoot! has launched.\n 9. Once your students are in the game, don't forget to share your screen to show the questions in Kahoot! \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE STUDENT EXPERIENCE\n\nInstead of navigating to kahoot.it to enter the game PIN, when teachers launch Kahoot! to students through Clever Portal, students\nwill automatically enter the game and be prompted to create their nickname. \n\nAfter teachers select Launch Kahoot!, the game will launch for students in the same tab that Clever was in, where they’ll be\nprompted to enter their nickname. After they enter their nickname and select the Ok, go button, they can start playing.\n\nIf you've chosen for their initials to populate, they'll be dropped right into the game without needing to click anything.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nWhy don’t I see the Launch a Kahoot feature in my Clever Portal?\n\n * This feature is currently only available for Teachers that have access to Kahoot! through Clever. You can gain access through\n   the Clever Library. Learn how to install applications from the Clever Library here. After you've installed the Kahoot!\n   application, you'll be able to use the Launch a Kahoot button! Some districts have chosen to disable the Clever Library. If you\n   don't see the Clever Library in your Clever Portal, your district has most likely decided to disable it.\n\nHow does Kahoot treat adding initials for students who have the same initials?\n\n * If there's more than one student with the same initials, the student whose app launches first will have their initials. Any\n   subsequent students will be brought to a page that says their nickname is taken, and they can choose a different nickname."

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWith Messages, Teachers can communicate with students and parents directly from the Clever Portal! From the Messages tab, teachers\ncan search for a student or parent and send them a message. From the student's/parent's Messages page, any of their teachers who\nhave enabled Messages will be listed and available to receive a chat. Clever Admins can disable Messages for the entire district\nat any time directly from the Dashboard.  Teachers can also turn their Messages on or off at any time. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nWHAT IS THE TEACHER EXPERIENCE?\n\nIn the enhanced teacher portal, Messages can be accessed by clicking the  button in the top right-hand corner.\n\nWhen a teacher uses Messages for the first time, they can customize how their account will be displayed to students. \n\nClever Tip: Teachers can change how their name is displayed and upload a custom picture or image by selecting the upload icon.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n * To begin a chat with a student, the teacher can simply type in the student's name in the search bar or select the student's\n   name from the list on the left-hand side.\n\n \n\nTeachers can also filter their students by class.

Clever District\nAdmins can access a teacher's message history by using the Clever search bar in the Clever Dashboard to locate the teacher. Then,\nselect Support tools > Download Messaging transcript.\n\n\n\nThe timestamp will be in UTC time zone (this is what the \"Z\" refers to). Please reference the following HC for more details:  For\nDistrict Admins: Downloading Messaging history.  If the transcript is requested for a student or guardian, announcements are not\nincluded. If the report is requested for a teacher, announcements are included.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNEEDING DETAILS ABOUT SPECIFIC MESSAGES\n\nIf you need details about specific messages, specific IP addresses and timestamps they can also be accessed when you navigate\nto Support tools > Download Messaging transcript. \n\nYou can also filter the Login Logs by date and by the ID of the user whose account the messages originated from. You can then view\nthe IP address associated with those logins.

Teachers can delete messages by hovering over the message(s) and selecting Delete.\n\nHow can teachers view unread messages?\n\n * Unread messages will remain in bold on the left-hand side, with a blue marker signifying that they are unread. When you click\n   an unread message, your chat thread with the recipient will open and you can read the message.\n * Once read, the red notification number at the top of the screen will decrease to the total number of unread messages that\n   remain.\n\nHow does Clever promote respectful messaging? \n\n * If a student sends a message that contains a swear word, a dialogue will display that prompts the student to confirm they would\n   like to send their message. They can choose to select Don't send and edit their message or to select Send and the message will\n   be delivered to their teacher. At this time, Clever cannot detect swear words that appear within another word or if appended by\n   a punctuation mark. Example: \"word!\"\n\nWhy does a message have an alphanumeric string instead of a name?\n\n * If a student's name is an alphanumeric string instead of their actual name, it is because the student has been unenrolled from\n   your class or they have left the district. We provide access to these historical messages as they may have content that is of\n   value to teachers. \n\nAre there any limitations to teacher messages due to the number of overall students enrolled in the teacher's sections?\n\n * Yes, teachers with greater than 2000 student associations will not have access to Clever Messages.\n\nCan students message one another using Clever Messages?\n\n * No, Clever Messages was specifically designed for student/family communications with teachers. Students do not have the ability\n   to send messages to other students."

This will give them the option not to send the message. \n\nHowever, in some cases, the student will confirm that they would like to send the message to their teacher anyways.

Voiding Badges\n6. Sync Pauses & Badge Invalidation\n7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWith Clever Badges, districts can allow students to use a physical Badge to log in to Clever without needing to enter login\ncredentials (i.e., a username and password). Instead, students can simply hold their Clever Badge up to their device webcam to be\nlogged in automatically.\n\nBy default, Clever Badges are intended for younger students or those with special needs. However, if your district would prefer to\nuse Badges for older students as well, please visit this article for information on setting up Badges that include pin\nrequirements: Clever Badges: How do I manage Badge PINs?\n\nPlease check out the following short video to see how Clever Badges can save both teachers and students time in the classroom! UI\nis outdated.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is to help you set up your Clever Badges. If you need help troubleshooting an issue, please see the following:\n\n * Clever Badges: How do I troubleshoot issues with Badges into Chromebooks?\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Chromebooks - Setup & Troubleshooting\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP REQUIREMENTS & INSTRUCTIONS \n\n\nSETUP REQUIREMENTS\n\nYou will need the following items for the implementation and use of Badges:\n\n * Compatible devices and/or internet browsers:\n   * Chromebooks\n   * iOS devices (e.g., iPads, iPhones)\n   * Windows devices\n   * Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer (2013 or later)\n   * Android devices with a webcam and compatible mobile browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Internet Explorer\n * A printer to print physical Badges on paper or labels\n * Computers and devices with webcams\n   * Please note that any variation of webcams will work as long as they are compatible with student devices.\n\n  This video is incredibly helpful for helping you set up Clever Badges for your schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSETUP INSTRUCTIONS\n\nTo begin, on your Clever Dashboard please navigate to SSO & Portal > Badges > Settings\nUnder the Access box, click Edit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: SPECIFY STUDENTS \n\nPlease begin by choosing which grade levels and students you would like to enable for Badges. The drop-down menu will allow you to\nselect specific grades. Clever will also provide you the option to include students with IEPs or students who are ELL\n automatically.\n\nPlease note that Clever will automatically invalidate badges as students age out of their district’s policy. For example, if\nbadges are enabled for Grade 2 and below, once a student is promoted from 2nd grade to 3rd grade their badge will be invalidated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: ADD SCHOOLS\n\nYou can now choose all schools or the specific schools you would like to enable for Badges, which will work in conjunction with\nthe student grade settings you selected in the first step. Once done, select Save to generate your student Badges!\n \n\n \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGENERATING & PRINTING CLEVER BADGES\n\n \n\nClever Tip: If Badges are not available to print for a school or grade level, navigate to SSO & Portal > Badges > Settings >\nAccess and confirm if Badges are enabled for the correct school and grade levels.   \n\n \n\nPlease note: Badges printed to PDF will match the Avery label template size for 2” square Avery labels perfectly! Additionally,\nprinting Badges on sticky labels is a great way to ensure students do not lose them, which is more likely to occur when printed on\npaper. Clever also highly recommends providing students with Badge holders such as those seen HERE.\n\n\n\n\nGENERATING AND PRINTING BADGES IN BULK\n\nBy navigating to SSO & Portal > Badges, you can select to download the Badges for individual schools, multiple schools, or all\nenabled schools. Clever Admins can choose to download active Badges or those that are associated with new users who have never had\nBadges generated previously.  \n\n \n\nDepending on the file size, Clever will either download the Badges directly to your computer or email you a secure .zip file that\ncan be downloaded to your desktop if the file exceeds our standard download limitations. The file will contain the following:\n\n * Folders with the names of each school \n   * Subfolders with student Badges by grade level, including the Badge QR codes and names of each student.\n     * PDF of the grade level Badges\n     * PNG images of Badges\n   * Subfolders with student Badges by sections (i.e., courses/classes), including the Badge QR codes and names of each student.\n     * PDF of the grade level Badges\n     * PNG images of Badges\n\n \n\n\n\nGENERATING INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BADGES\n\nBadges can also be generated or voided on a per-student basis. To do this, please begin by searching for the student using\nthe Clever Dashboard search bar or by navigating to the  Data browser > Students tab. Once you have located the student's record\nto access their profile page, select Support Tools in the top right to void their Badge or generate a new one.\n\nPlease note: If the option to void or generate a Badge isn't available for a student, the student isn't included in the scope\nspecified when you or another admin set up Clever Badges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBadge pins can also be updated from a student's profile page in Clever. For more information, please visit: Clever Badges: How do\nI manage Badge PINs?\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN WITH CLEVER BADGES\n\nBelow is the expected login flow for a student using their Badge to authenticate with Clever:\n\n * The student will navigate to either clever.com/badges or the district's custom Clever login page. Clever Badges are designed to\n   be used directly with Clever, and a QR reader won't log you in to Clever.\n * They will select the Clever Badge log in option.\n * If they have not previously provided access, they will be prompted to allow Clever access to their device camera so they can\n   scan their Badge. \n * At this point, their webcam will activate so they can hold their Badge up to the camera. Once Clever's sensors recognize the\n   Badge, the user will see a green check mark and be logged in successfully.\n   * Please note that if the student sees a red X, their Badge login was unsuccessful.\n\n \n\nPlease note: Clever Badges are an independent login method, separate from other login methods such as Google, Active Directory,\nand Clever Passwords, which means Clever does not have access to your students' login credentials for alternative Identity\nProviders (IdPs). Please get in touch with your district's tech support for issues with student usernames and passwords.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVOIDING BADGES\n\nClever Badges can be voided and regenerated if needed. If a student loses their Badge, the best practice would be to direct them\nto immediately reach out to their teacher, IT support, or a Clever Admin. The missing Badge should be voided to protect the\nstudent's information. Once voided, a new Clever Badge can be issued.\n\nVoiding Clever Badges is a safeguard for protecting students. Therefore, this is not a feature that can be disabled. Clever Badges\nare comparable to a student's login credentials. If their login credentials or Clever Badge are compromised, they should be reset.\n\nTo void a student's Clever Badge, Clever Admins can navigate to the student's profile page using the Clever Search bar at the top\nof the Clever Dashboard. Choose the Support Tools option to the right of the page to void the student's Badge. A new Badge can\nalso be generated from the Support Tools menu.  \n\nClever Badges can also be voided in bulk for district school locations by navigating to SSO & Portal > Badges. Once voided, new\nBadges can be generated.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease note: In July 2025, Badge invalidation will be required for all schools using Clever.\n\n\n\nSYNC PAUSES & BADGE INVALIDATION\n\nBy default, Clever voids all student Badges after a district's student information system (SIS) summer sync pause has ended,\nexcept for districts that choose to opt-out of this recommended practice. Clever also automatically invalidates badges as students\nage out of their district’s policy.\n\nVoiding Badges is a critical security measure that helps to keep student information secure from one school year to the next. If\nyou opt-out of invalidation, we highly recommend that you change your settings. \n\nClever Admins that have opted into Sync Pause emails will receive a notification before the sync pause ends letting them know that\nwe will be voiding student Badges. Learn more about email preferences here.\n\nTo ensure your Clever Badges are safe and secure from this year to the next:\n\n1. Navigate to SSO & Portal > Badges > Settings > Security\n\n2. Click Edit\n\n \n\n3. Ensure the yearly Badge expiration toggle is green with a checkmark.\n\n\n \n\n4. Click Save\n\n\n\nFor districts that do not choose to opt-out of the summer Badge invalidation process, student Badges will be invalidated when the\ndistrict's summer sync pause ends.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\n\nOur district is not pausing our sync this year. Will our student's Clever Badges be invalidated?\n\n * By default, Clever will only invalidate Badges when a district's sync was paused and is scheduled to end, so we will not void\n   your student Badges in this case.\n\n\nWill I be notified before our Badges are invalidated?\n\n * We do not send out alerts, but Badges are scheduled to be invalidated based on your district's sync pause end date, which is\n   visible from your Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings page.\n\n\nWe paused and unpaused our SIS sync before July, having already completed our SIS rollover. Will our Badges be invalidated? \n\n * Clever will only invalidate student Badges for districts whose sync pause is scheduled to end between July 1st and October\n   1st. \n\n\nWe unpaused our SIS sync during the July 1st and October 1st window. How will that affect our Badge invalidation?\n * If you pause your sync during the July 1st - October 1st window, and the date you choose to resume SIS syncs is a week or more\n   away from today's date, Clever will void your Badges.  However, if your SIS sync will resume in less than a week, Clever will\n   not void Badges due to short notice.\n\nI downloaded a set of Badges, and there are some Badges missing. What do I do?\n * If you are noticing there are students missing a Badge in your download, make sure to double-check check they meet the criteria\n   you set in your Badge settings. Once you have confirmed the students meet the criteria, you can download the new Badges for\n   these students. \n\nOur school district is changing SISs, do we need to create new Clever Badges?\n * If the students' SIS IDs aren't changing, then you do not need to create new Badges. This is because Clever Badges are tied to\n   the students' Clever ID, which is created based on the SIS ID. So, if the SIS ID doesn't change, the Clever ID won't change,\n   and there's no need to create new Badges.\n\n \n\n \n\n\nLooking for additional support setting up the Clever Portal?

These passwords are often trivially guessable, and in some cases, the passwords are the same for every student.\n\n\nAnyone who has a printed Clever Badge, or a photo of one, can use it to log in. Thus, Clever Badges have a ‘physical access’\nattack surface that is very similar to that of passwords printed and distributed by teachers. However, Clever Badges are\nsignificantly more resistant to brute forcing or password guessing than simple passwords.\n\n\nBadges don’t necessarily help with other security problems, like phishing. Also, there is always a risk in handing out physical\ncredentials, so make sure your teachers read the security tips on our teacher guide.\n\n\nOur primary goal with Clever Badges is to make it easier for young learners to log in. We believe that Badges make a better\nsecurity and usability trade-off in K-2 classrooms than existing password systems do today. We know from experience that not all\nusers make the same risk decisions. So while Clever Badges will be a better overall choice at some schools, it may not be right\nfor others.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW CAN I KEEP MY BADGES SECURE?\n\nHere’s a few tips on how to keep your Badges secure:\n\n\nDigital security:\n \n\n * Limit the number of people who have access to the Badges PDF file. Don’t store the file in a location where people who don’t\n   need it can access it, like a district- or school-wide file share.\n * Permanently delete the PDF file (e.g. empty the recycle bin) after you have printed it.\n * Emails are usually transmitted without encryption. Generally speaking, we encourage you to never email anyone an image of a\n   badge. If you do email Badges PDF files, be aware that they may be viewable. For more information, please see Wikipedia’s\n   article on email privacy.\n\n\nPhysical security:\n \n\n * Keep Clever Badges in the classroom. To access applications outside of school, students can manually log in at your district’s\n   portal URL\n * Invalidate lost Badges as soon as possible to prevent unauthorized logins\n * Don’t let students take pictures of their Clever Badge or borrow badges from one another \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCAN A BADGE BE FORGED?\n\nTechnically, it is possible, but it would be extremely difficult!  Part of the data encoded by each Badge is a 12-byte token,\ngenerated using a cryptographically secure random number generation algorithm. 12 bytes of entropy means that, on average, you’\nneed 2^(12*8)/2 attempts to guess the token - approximately 40 octillion attempts. Even if someone made one million guesses per\nsecond, it would take over a quadrillion years to guess.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN A BADGE IS STOLEN OR LOST?\n\nTeachers, School Tech Leads, and administrators can void Badges using their Clever accounts. When a Badge is voided, the record is\nregenerated in the database and the old badge can no longer be used to log in. Clever uses the sequence number in the Badge to\ntrack Badges from generation to usage, to help clarify situations where badges have been improperly used.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW SECURE IS CLEVER?\n\nWe’ve built security into our infrastructure at the software and network levels to ensure that student data is secure. Clever\nperforms security audits and code review as part of our development process, and we run a bug bounty program to reward researchers\nwho responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to Clever. For more information on Clever’s security practices, check out our blog post\non Clever Badges & Our Commitment to Security, along with our Security Whitepaper"

Troubleshooting forgotten PINs\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAs a security precaution, some districts require students to enter a secure PIN when logging in to Clever with a Badge. In\naddition, Clever requires a Badge PIN for all students in seventh grade or above who log in using a Badge, minus students with an\nIEP or ELL status. Clever Admins can disable Badge PINS for students in these grades levels on an individual basis, but not for a\ngroup of students.\n\nA district can choose to adjust the PIN requirement settings for Badges to begin at an earlier grade. This can be managed from\nthe Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal > Badges > Settings page. \n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSETTING BADGE PINS\n\nTo set a PIN, students will navigate to clever.com/badges, hold their Badge up to the camera, and then be authenticated to the\npage displayed below.\n\nThe first time a student uses a PIN-enabled Badge, they will see the screen below prompting them to set a PIN. \n\nOn this screen, the student will enter their new PIN twice and then be signed in to Clever! After this initial setup, your\nstudents will be able to log into Clever using their Badge and their PIN.\n\n\n\nBadge PINs can be manually enabled or disabled from a student's details card in the Clever Dashboard > Data Browser or from the\nstudent profile page using the Support tools drop-down arrow. These Badge management options are available to District Admins,\nDistrict Help Desk, and School Tech Leads.   \n\n\n \n\nPlease note: Pin requirements are set when a Badge is first generated. As such, if a student's ELL or IEP status changes later,\nClever will not automatically update the requirement for a Badge Pin. Also, any student who has a Badge outside the scoped Grades\nwith Badges setting will need a PIN (including IEP or ELL students who are set to Create individually rather than Auto include in\nStep 1 of the Badges settings). To reset the student's pin requirements, their current Badge should be voided and a new Badge\ngenerated for them.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING FORGOTTEN PINS\n\n * Students: Here is a resource to share with students who need help with their PIN: For Students: How do I log in to Clever using\n   a Badge?\n * Teachers: Here is how teachers can help their students log in using a backup PIN: For Teachers: How do I help my student log\n   into Clever?"

The login flow for most users (Chrome OS 99 and above) is\noutlined below. Since the login flow for third-party IdPs is managed by Google, it is not possible for Clever to alter the login\nflow or revert to the previous behavior of Chrome OS 98 and lower.\n\nOccasionally Google will incorporate popup windows that can not be avoided and disrupt the login flow, requiring the users to\nclick through to close the popup.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStudents who are using Badges will go through the following login flow:\n \n\n1. Upon device power on, users will be directly taken to the Clever Badge login screen.\n\n\n\n \n\n2. The Clever Badge login screen will appear. If prompted, grant access to the device camera and scan your Clever Badge. \n \n\nIf the Clever Badge is valid, a green checkmark will appear and the Clever Portal will launch on the student's Chromebook.

Common Issues and Resolutions\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article details some troubleshooting tips districts can use when students have issues with Badges, including invalid and\nexpired Badges and logging into Google Chromebooks using Clever Badges.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON ISSUES AND RESOLUTIONS\n\n \n\n\nBADGE IS INVALID\n\n\n\nThis error message means that the student is no longer included in the scope of users who are assigned Badges.\n\nHere's an example: Let's say your district's Badge scope is for students in third grade and below. At the end of the year, the\nthird-grade students move on to fourth grade. If any of those new fourth-graders tried to use their old Badge, they would get this\ninvalid message, since they are no longer included in the scoped users for Badges.\n\n \n\n\nBADGE IS EXPIRED\n\n\n\nIf you see this error message when attempting to log in with a Badge, it means that the Badge's expiration date has passed. The\nstudent can generate a new Badge by clicking the Set up a new Badge button, or by asking their teacher for help.\n\n \n\n\nYOUR CONNECTION IS NOT PRIVATE ERROR\n\nIf your web filter is blocking access, you will see a \"Your connection is not private\" error when using a Clever Badge on the\nChromebook login page. You may need to adjust your web filter in order to use Clever Badges with Chromebooks.\n\n\n\nThis occurs because Chromebooks do not load custom root certificates (for instance, those used by web filters) before sign-in\noccurs. Therefore, you will need to allowlist certain URLs so that they are not intercepted and the correct certificate is\npresented during the login process.\n\n \n\n\nALLOW-LISTING NECESSARY DOMAINS\n\nThe following domains must be allow-listed for Clever Badges to function properly:\n\n 1. *.clever.com\n 2. *.s3.amazonaws.com\n 3. accounts.google.com (if your district uses Clever Badges for Chromebooks)\n\nWith these changes, we believe that districts using any common web filter (such as iBoss, Lightspeed, Cipafilter, Securly,\nZScaler, and Fortinet) can use Clever Badges with Chromebooks.\n\n \n\n\nPOPUP WINDOW INTERRUPTING THE LOGIN FLOW\n\nOccasionally Google will incorporate popup windows that can not be avoided and disrupt the login flow, requiring users to click\nthrough to close the popup in order to successfully log in."

Users log into Chromebooks, then access Clever\n\n\nEach method can be configured separately for different Organizational Units (OUs).\n\nSince Clever integrates with many identity providers, including Active Directory, Clever can serve as the authentication pathway\nfor both Badge and Active Directory users! See below for details on this integration.  \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n * Clever enabled as the third party identity provider in the Google Admin Console (Security Settings > Setup SSO with third party\n   identity provider)\n * Active Directory enabled as an identity provider in Clever (Clever Dashboard > SSO & Portal  > SSO settings > Login method)\n * Staff and students that'll use Chromebooks must be active users in Clever\n * Staff and students who'll use Chromebooks must have their Google email address populated in Clever\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSETUP\n\nStep 1 - Setup Active Directory authentication into Clever\nTo pass through authentication for non-Badge users, we'll need to add Active Directory as a login method for Clever. Directions\nfor adding Active Directory can be found here: Single sign-on (SSO) with Active Directory Federation Services\n\n\nStep 2 - Upload student/teacher Google emails to Clever\nIn order to authenticate both Clever Badge and Active Directory users into Chromebooks, the district will need to ensure that all\nstudents and teachers have Google emails synced to Clever. If these emails are't populated in the SIS, we can enable manual email\nuploads as described here: How do I upload emails that are not in my SIS?\n\n\nStep 3 - Customize login flow (optional)\nDistricts can adjust settings in the admin console to tweak the login flow to best meet the needs of your district. See below for\nmore details!\n\n\nStep 4 - Apply settings and test logins\nApply the settings for Clever single sign-on (SSO) into Chromebooks as described here: \n\n * https://schools.clever.com/badges/chromebook/wizard\n\n\nFor districts that are actively using Active Directory to sign users into Chromebooks, we recommend completing login tests at a\ntime when most users are't utilizing their Chromebooks to reduce interruptions to learning.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCUSTOMIZING THE LOGIN FLOW (OPTIONAL)\n\nOption 1: Bypass badge login\nBy default, once users open the Chromebook and select \"Next\" they'll be presented with the badge login screen. If the district\nwould prefer, this behavior can be adjusted so the district's general login page is presented first, facilitating faster logins\nfor users logging in via Active Directory. \n\n\nTo implement this option, begin by navigating to the Security Settings page in the Google Admin Console and scroll down to\nthe SSO section. Under Setup SSO with third party identity provider, let's adjust the \"Sign-in page URL\"\n\n\n\nCurrently your sign-in URL should look something like this: \n\n * https://samlidp.clever.com/chromebook-login/assert/582df1eb56619d0100000482?specify_auth=badges\n\nThis URL contains a parameter that forwards users directly to the badge authentication page:\n\n\n\nLet's adjust the URL by removing: ?specify_auth=badges\nThe result should look like this: \n\n * https://samlidp.clever.com/chromebook-login/assert/582df1eb56619d0100000482\n\nThis will send all users to the general login page for your district! From there, users can select their preferred login method.\nHere is what the login page will now look like:\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Pass-through Google authentication into Clever Portal\n\nPass through authentication ensures that all users are automatically logged into the Clever Portal when logged into a Chromebook.\n\nTo configure this setting, navigate to the \"User Settings\" page in the Google Admin Console. Depending on how you have applied the\nsettings, you may need to adjust the Homepage, Pages to Load on Startup, or both. Currently the settings will look similar to\nbelow:\n\nTo enable pass-through authentication, add:?skip=1&specify_auth=google to your district URL. Your district specific URL can be\nfound here: https://schools.clever.com/portal \n\n\nThe result should look like this: https://clever.com/in/cleverdemo?skip=1&specify_auth=google \n\n\nLogin experience\n\n 1. Chrome OS 98 and below: Open Chromebook, press “Next”           \n 2. If a user logs in using:\n    * Badges: user selects 'Log in with Clever Badges'. \n      * The user scans their Badge and is authenticated into Clever and Google/Chromebook!\n    * ADFS Credentials:\n      * User selects 'Log in with Active Directory.' The Active Directory login screen is presented. User logs in to ADFS. ADFS\n        authenticates the user into Clever, Clever authenticates the user into Google/Chromebook.\n\n\n3. Clever portal launches and learning begins!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCHROMEBOOK SAFETY FEATURE\n\nWe'll soon offer an optional query param on the Badges login screen called `chromebook_safety.' If it is present, the login screen\nwon't show the \"Alternate Login\" button to allow non-Badge logins. This serves as a way to definitively prevent users from\naverting web filters and accessing websites outside of Clever. \n\n\n\nTo enable this feature, add the following as a query param on the Chromebook Sign-On\nURL: https://samlidp.clever.com/chromebook-login/assert/YourDistrictCleverID?specify_auth=badges&chromebook_safety=true\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated article: Single Sign-on (SSO): multiple IDPs for Google Workspace"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n 1. Overview\n 2. Setup steps \n    a. NetBIOS domain\n    b. Locating user credentials\n    c. Downloading software\n\nPlease note: These instructions only apply to Windows devices that accept Active Directory user credentials. If your users use\nEntra ID credentials to access Windows devices, please follow the steps listed in our Setup guide for Clever SSO into Entra ID.\nWhen using the Entra ID instructions, ensure that you do not have the MSI file for this AD On-prem configuration installed on your\nWindows devices.\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever Badges makes accessing apps painless for young students, logging them into Clever with a simple personalized QR code.\n\nTo get to Clever, however, students often still need to enter a username and password to access their device. To make that\nexperience simpler, we also offer Badges into Windows for devices that utilize Active Directory logins.\n\nWhen Badges into Windows is set up, students can log in to their device and Clever with just their Badge.\n\n\n\nSTUDENT EXPERIENCE\n\nFor students, the login experience is simple. The login screen of the device will prompt them to scan their Clever Badge, they’ll\nhold the Badge up to the camera, and they’re instantly logged into the device, into Clever, and into all of their Clever\napplications.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note if your district is using shared Windows devices for students, the device will remember the login option that the\nprevious user selected before. Thus, if a user selects Other user, as seen in the image below, the Windows device will provide\nthat same option for the next user who logs into the device. Be sure the user selects the correct login method from the device\nlogin page.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP STEPS\n\nThere are three basic steps to setting up this configuration:\n\n 1. Provide your NetBIOS domain\n 2. Locate user credentials\n 3. Download software\n\nThe setup process should take no more than 10 minutes, and you won’t need to do any configuration within Active Directory. You’ll\nalso want to ensure that you have Badges set up, and that the devices you plan to use have webcams.\n\n\nClever’s setup wizard will guide you through each of these steps. Navigate to the wizard by going to Clever Dashboard > SSO &\nPortal > Badges > Windows.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFINDING YOUR NETBIOS DOMAIN\n\nEach Active Directory instance has a NetBIOS domain, which is not the same as your DNS domain name. You likely won’t have this\ninformation on hand, but retrieving it is easy. Open Windows PowerShell as a user logged into the domain and paste in the command\nbelow:\n\n\nCommand: $ENV:USERDOMAIN\n\nThe result will look like this:\n\n\n\nPaste that domain into Clever, and you’re ready to move on to the next step.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOCATING USER CREDENTIALS\n\nIn order for Clever to log students into Windows devices equipped with Active Directory logins, we need to know student Active\nDirectory (AD) credentials. Student AD credentials in Clever must stay in sync with actual student AD credentials. If they get out\nof sync, students will still be able to log into the devices with Active Directory, but won’t be able to utilize the Badge login\noption.\n\n \n\nClever Tip: We recommend disabling password changes in Active Directory for students who will be using this setup.\n\n\nThere are three different ways that you can locate user credentials:\n\n 1. Select them from the dropdown (recommended)\n 2. Use a custom configuration (recommended)\n 3. Upload a csv (not recommended)\n\n\n\nSELECT FROM DROPDOWN (RECOMMENDED)\n\nThe easiest and most reliable way to provide those credentials is by indicating where they are within your existing SIS sync. For\nexample, if student AD usernames are their email addresses, and passwords are their student number, and those fields are already\nsyncing to Clever regularly, you would select those fields in the dropdowns within the Badges into Windows configuration wizard.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the credentials for the sample student match the Active Directory credentials you have on file.\n\n\n\n\nCUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS (RECOMMENDED)\n\nIf student AD usernames and/or passwords are syncing to Clever already, but aren’t neatly contained in a single field, we’re still\nable to get you set up! You can use a custom configuration to provide those credentials. Instead of selecting a single field,\nyou’ll select “Custom” in the appropriate dropdown list and paste in one of the formulas below:\n\n\n\n \n\nWe support the following fields for custom formulas:\n\n * sis_id\n * email\n * student_number\n * state_id\n * credentials.district_username\n * credentials.district_password\n\n \n\nExamples of using formulas for credentials\n\nExample student: Scott Kelly\nEmail: sykelly@cleverusd.edu\nUsername: skelly19\n \n\nStudent AD usernames or passwords are...Formula [fill in portions in brackets]Example formulaSample result for the student\naboveUsername from the sync plus my district's email domain{{credentials.district_username}}[add domain name\nhere]{{credentials.district_username}}@cleverusd.eduskelly19@cleverusd.edu A specific word/phrase that's the same for every\nstudent[add that word/phrase here]appleappleFirst initial, last name{{substr name.first 0 1}}{{name.last}}{{substr name.first 0\n1}}{{name.last}}skellyTheir email without the domain{{textBefore email \"@\"}}{{textBefore email \"@\"}} sykellySomething\nelse...Contact us via the form in our Help Center and we'll create a formula for you!\n\n \n\nOnce you’ve entered the appropriate formula, make sure that the credentials for the sample student match the Active Directory\ncredentials you have on file.\n\n\n\nUPLOADING CREDENTIALS (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n\nIf your student Active Directory credentials aren’t contained anywhere within your synced data, and can’t be derived from your\nsynced data, you have the option of uploading those credentials to Clever. Because those credentials need to stay in sync, we\nrecommend re-uploading that information at least once per week to ensure that new students can utilize the integration. To reveal\nthe upload option, choose “Username uploaded from .csv” and/or “Password uploaded from .csv” in the dropdown.\n\n \n\nFile Name (required): students.csv\nFormatting (required): student_id, username, password\n\nSample file:\n\n\nWeb Upload Tool:\n\n\nYou can also automate that upload via SFTP to the “credentials-sftp.clever.com/clever-windows” folder. The SFTP upload URL,\nusername, and password of your SFTP Settings - Saved Passwords Applications can be found at Clever Dashboard > Sync > Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on the tools that you can use to access and upload files to your credentials SFTP server, please see this\nHelp Center article: What are some recommended tools for SFTP syncs?\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDOWNLOADING SOFTWARE\n\nFinally, you’ll want to install Clever’s software on any machines you want to have this login option. The installer is an MSI\nfile, so you can remotely install this software in the same way that you would any other piece of software on your Windows\nmachines."

Technical requirements for Badges\n5. How do I generate Badges from my Portal?\n6. Devices without cameras\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever Badges are a great tool to ease logins in the classroom at your school site. This article will discuss how Clever Badges\nwork, the technical requirements, and how you can generate Clever Badges for students at your school site. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT ARE CLEVER BADGES?\n\nClever Badges allow students to use a physical Badge to log in to Clever in lieu of typing in credentials to authenticate\nusers. Badges are an easier way for the youngest students to access their apps. School Tech Leads can print Badges for individual\nstudents, entire school sites, or sections, as long as Badges have been enabled by a Clever Admin.\n\nBadges are tied to the student. As such, changes in school, teacher, or section will not affect the Badge. \n\nGrade-level access for Badges is managed by your district administrator. If Badges are not available for the desired grade level,\nplease contact your district support contact. For more information about enabling Badges for your district, please see this Help\nCenter article.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO CLEVER BADGES WORK?\n\n 1. Students navigate to clever.com/badges and click Allow in the browser prompt to give Clever access to their camera. They can\n    also go to their district's Clever URL and click the Badges icon. Clever Badges are designed to be used directly with Clever,\n    and a QR reader won't log the student in to Clever.\n 2. The webcam will activate and students should hold up their Badge to the camera. Once the code is scanned the screen border\n    will flash green.\n 3. Students will then be redirected to their Clever Portal.\n\n\n\nPro Tip: Security\nBadges provide direct access to a student's Clever account and should be protected just like a password. Anyone who has access to\na Badge can sign in as a student and access their accounts in both Clever and connected applications. Please protect the security\nof your students and do not share images of the QR code publicly on social media.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BADGES\n\nYou will need to following items to implement and use Badges:\n \n\n 1. Supported web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari)\n 2. Printer\n 3. Computers/devices with webcam\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I GENERATE BADGES FROM MY PORTAL?\n\nBadges can be downloaded using the directions below. They can also be downloaded by teachers and parents/guardians using these\ndirections: \n\n * How to download a Clever Badge as a teacher\n * How to download a Clever Badge as a parent/guardian\n\nFor School Tech Leads: Printing Individual Badges\n\n 1. From your Clever Portal, navigate to your Dashboard\n 2. Once in the Dashboard, search for the student in the search bar\n 3. If the student does not have a Badge generated, select Create Clever Badge on the right-hand side of their Profile\n 4. If the student's Clever Badge is already generated, select a download option\n\nPlease note: If you select Void Clever Badge the student's Clever Badge will no longer function and you will need to generate a\nnew Badge for them.\n\n\nFor School Tech Leads: Printing school site and section Badges\n\n\n 1. From your Clever Portal, navigate to your Dashboard\n\n\n\n2. Once in the Dashboard, choose Badges\n\n\n\n3. In the \"Overview\" tab, you will have two options to generate Badges. Whenever a new student joins your school (within the\nconfigured grade range for Badges), you can click New to generate Badges for only those new students at the school.\n\n\nOr, you can select All to generate Badges for all the students at your school. Clicking All will not void any existing Badges. It\nwill simply regenerate any existing badges as well as create new badges for any students who did not yet have one.\n\n\n\n4. Once you select an option, the Badges will either be emailed to your or immediately start downloading, to a zip file with PDFs\nof the Badges. You will have the option to either print by grade level or by section.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDEVICES WITHOUT CAMERAS\n\nIf a student does not have access to a device with a camera, they can log in using the district's normal login method. (e.g. Log\nin with Google, Log in with Active Directory, Log in with Clever). If you require assistance with identifying their username and\npassword for one of these login methods, please reach out to your district's tech support contact . \n\n\n\n \n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions! You can always submit a ticket to Clever Support."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Prerequisites\n3. Configure Clever as an IdP for Entra ID\n4. Configure Entra ID as a Service Provider (SP) for Clever\n5. Verify federated authentication between Clever and Entra ID\n6. Removing Clever as an IdP for Entra ID \n7. Troubleshooting\n\nPlease note: Microsoft’s current version requirements can be found here.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn this article, you'll learn the steps to configure Clever as a SAML identity provider (IdP) for Entra ID. Once configured, users\nwill be able to use their Clever credentials or Badges to sign in to Entra ID, including on Windows deployments.\n\n \n\nPlease note that if your district would like to utilize Clever Badges for sign-in to Entra-joined Windows devices, you will need\nto complete the steps listed below to configure Clever as an IdP for Entra ID. Once Clever is configured, students will be able to\nuse Badges to sign in to their Entra-joined Windows devices. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nTo configure Clever as an IdP for Entra ID, the following prerequisites must be met:\n\n 1. An Entra ID tenant, with one or multiple custom Domain Name System (DNS) domains (i.e., domains that aren't in the format\n    *.onmicrosoft.com)\n    * If the federated domain hasn't yet been added to Entra ID, you will need to have access to the DNS domain to create a DNS\n      record. This is required to verify the ownership of the DNS namespace\n    * Learn how to add your custom domain name using the Azure Active Directory portal\n 2. Access to Entra ID with an account with the Global Administrator role\n 3. Access to Clever with an account with the District admin role\n\nTo test federation, the following prerequisites must be met:\n\n 1. A Clever environment, with users already created\n\nPlease note: Users require a matching field in Clever that is set to the same value as the ImmutableId in Entra ID.\n\n\n * * If your Entra users do not have an ImmutableId, Clever recommends mirroring the email address to that field. You can learn\n     how to update the ImmutableId for individual users in Entra using the PowerShell example shown here.\n   * If the ImmutableId does not match a field in Clever, please update your data in Clever to contain a field that matches the\n     ImmutableId. Learn more about custom fields here.\n     \n     \n\n 2. Individual Entra ID accounts are already created: each Clever user will require a matching account defined in Entra ID. These\n    accounts are commonly created through automated solutions, for example:\n    * School Data Sync (SDS)\n    * Entra ID Connect sync for an environment with on-premises AD DS\n    * PowerShell scripts that call the Microsoft Graph API\n    * Provisioning tools offered by the IdP - this capability is offered by Clever as a dedicated offering\n\nPlease see here for Microsoft’s current version requirements.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONFIGURE CLEVER AS AN IDP FOR ENTRA ID\n\n 1. To add Entra ID, please navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add Applications page, and search for the Entra ID\n    app in the search bar. Click to request the application. \n\n\n \n 2. Once the app is ready, the District admin will be notified via email to accept the invitation to the app\n 3. Sign in to Clever as a District admin, then go to your Entra ID page via Application > My application > Entra ID, and click\n    Begin setup to set up which of your users can access the app. Don’t worry, you can always come back and edit this setting at\n    any time. \n\n\n 4. Once you have set up sharing, go to the Settings tab and configure the Entra ID SAML app with the following details: \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nVariable\n\nValue\n\nAssertion Consumer Service Urlhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srfEntity IDurn:federation:MicrosoftOnlineName ID\nFormaturn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:email\n\n \n\n 5. Ensure that the Attribute for each user type is set to the field in Clever that contains the matching value to the ImmutableId\n    in Entra ID. If you are using the recommended value of Email, select Email from the dropdown. If you are using a custom field,\n    select Custom from the dropdown and enclose the custom field name in double curly brackets using all lowercase, for example,\n    {{ext.field_name}}.\n\n\n\n\nThe other parameters should already be pre-configured.  \n\nPlease take note of the Identity Provider Metadata URL value, as it will be required in the next step. For example:\nhttps://samlidp.clever.com/saml-azure-ad/metadata/<GUID>;\n\nPlease note: Federation won't work if the app has a launch date set in the future. Once the application is ready to be used, ask\nClever Support to change the launch date.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONFIGURE ENTRA ID AS A SERVICE PROVIDER (SP) FOR CLEVER\n\nThe configuration of Entra ID consists of changing the authentication method for the custom DNS domains. This configuration can be\ndone using PowerShell.\n \n\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force\n\n\n \n\nNote, depending on your environment, the command above may give the following error: Set-ExecutionPolicy: Operation is not\nsupported on this platform. In these cases, simply proceed with the remaining commands.\n\n\nModify the $idpMetadataUrl and $DomainName variables of the following script to match your environment. When prompted to\nauthenticate to Entra ID, use the credentials of an account with the Global Administrator role.\n\n \n\nInstall-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser\nImport-Module Microsoft.Graph\n\n$domainId = \"your domain here\"\n$idpMetadataUrl = \"your SAML metadata URL here\"\n\n$xml = [Xml](Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $idpMetadataUrl -ContentType \"application/xml\").content\n\n$cert = -join $xml.EntityDescriptor.IDPSSODescriptor.KeyDescriptor.KeyInfo.X509Data.X509Certificate.Split()\n$issuerUri = $xml.EntityDescriptor.entityID\n$signinUri = $xml.EntityDescriptor.IDPSSODescriptor.SingleSignOnService | ? { $_.Binding.Contains('Redirect') } | % { $_.Location }\n$signoutUri = \"https://clever.com/logout\"\"\n$displayName = \"Clever Identity\"\nConnect-MGGraph -Scopes \"Domain.ReadWrite.All\", \"Directory.AccessAsUser.All\"\n\n$domainAuthParams = @{\n  DomainId = $domainId\n  IssuerUri = $issuerUri\n  DisplayName = $displayName\n  ActiveSignInUri = $signinUri\n  PassiveSignInUri = $signinUri\n  SignOutUri = $signoutUri\n  SigningCertificate = $cert\n  PreferredAuthenticationProtocol = \"saml\"\n  federatedIdpMfaBehavior = \"acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp\"\n}\n\nNew-MgDomainFederationConfiguration @domainAuthParams\n\n\n \n\nNote, the configuration may take up to 60 minutes to update before end users will be redirected to your Clever Portal login when\nnavigating to https://portal.azure.com/.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVERIFY FEDERATED AUTHENTICATION BETWEEN CLEVER AND ENTRA ID\n\n \n\nFrom a private browser session, navigate to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with a Clever account:\n\n 1. As the username, use the email as defined in Clever\n 2. The user will be redirected to Clever to sign in\n 3. After Clever authentication, the user will be redirected back to Entra ID and be signed in\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREMOVING CLEVER AS AN IDP FOR ENTRA ID\n\n\n\n\nTo remove Clever as an IdP for your Entra ID domain, run the following command using PowerShell:\n \nRemove-MgDomainFederationConfiguration -DomainId <EntraDomain.org>\n \nFor more information, see Microsoft Support or reach out to your Microsoft support contact.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\n\n\n\nEntra is not recognizing my user\n\nThis usually happens when the ImmutableId field in Entra is not being matched for this user in Clever. This may look like\nMicrosoft error AADSTS51004 or AADSTS90072.\n\n \n\nTo correct:\n\n 1. Double check what the ImmutableId is set to for this user in Entra using the following PowerShell - replace\n    [user@district.org] with the UserId for your user. Check the value displayed after OnPremisesImmutableId.\n\nget-mguser -UserId [user@district.org] -property DisplayName,Mail,OnPremisesImmutableId,UserPrincipalName,Id | Format-List DisplayName,Mail,OnPremisesImmutableId,UserPrincipalName,Id\n\n 2. Check which field you are matching on in the Entra ID app in the Clever Admin dashboard. Navigate to\n    https://schools.clever.com/applications/saml-azure-ad/settings and check which field is set for the matching value for your\n    user type. Ensure that you are matching on the correct field in Clever that contains the ImmutableId value. If you are not\n    matching on the right field, update that field by returning to the Configure Clever as an IdP for Entra ID section and see\n    step 5.\n     \n 3. Check the value of the matching field for your user in Clever. Use the Data Browser or search for your user at the top of your\n    dashboard. On the user’s overview page, ensure that value in the field you are matching on exactly matches the ImmutableId in\n    Entra that you found in step 1.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n\nGetting started with Analytics? Check out our Product Spotlight: Supporting your school and district with Clever Analytics,\n available in Clever Academy!\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nEdtech Analytics shows you all of your district's app usage in one place down to the school and grade level, whether or not they\nare integrated with Clever. Best of all, it’s free!\n\nThrough our opt-in-only secure browser extension, you’ll get visibility into how many students and teachers are using apps added\nby the district through Clever, added by teachers through Clever Library, and hundreds of others accessed outside of Clever.\nEdtech Analytics is currently available for district-managed Chromebook and Windows devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\nTo enable Edtech Analytics in your district, you’ll need to set up the Clever Plus extension. Even if your district already uses\nthe standard Clever browser extension for students and teachers to access SSO (Saved Passwords) applications, you’ll still need to\nset up the Clever Plus extension, which will replace the standard Clever extension. Clever Plus supports both SSO (Saved\nPasswords) applications and Edtech Analytics. You can find a short setup guide in your Clever Dashboard > Analytics > Edtech\nAnalytics page which will allow you to download the new extension.\n\nThe setup guide is only visible to Clever Admins (find out more about user roles here). If you are setting up Edtech Analytics on\nChromebooks, we recommend adding your Google Console admin. Learn how to add others here.\n\nTo learn more about how to set up deploying Edtech Analytics for Edge using Microsoft Intune, click here.\n\nFor Microsoft Intune as the mobile device manager on Windows as the operating system, please see:\n\n * For Chrome\n * For Edge\n\n Edtech Analytics is available for Chrome and Edge browsers. Edtech Analytics is not supported for mobile devices.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVIEWING EDTECH ANALYTICS DATA\n\nOnce your usage data is ready, you can access it from your Clever Dashboard > Analytics > Edtech Analytics page. \n\nFilters:  \n\n * Districts can filter district data by time range, including last school year, this school year, the last 28 days, or the last 7\n   days. You can also filter by school and grade level. Only schools and grades with usage data will be shown in drop-downs.\n   \n   \n\nReported Users\n\nStudents reported and teachers reported provides insight into the usage from devices where the Clever Plus extension is installed.\nTo be counted, users need to: \n\n * Be synced to Clever (learn more here about syncing to Clever)\n * Have an email address (Chromebook) or a username (Windows device) \n * Have an Active Directory or Google session running on their device \n * Be actively using the application (i.e. spends at least 10 seconds on the app page)\n\nThese numbers are updated daily. \n\nYou can view reported users by day by hovering over the historical trendline.\n\n\n\nPlease note: Edtech Analytics only reports data from devices with the Clever Plus extension enabled and does not include usage on\npersonal mobile devices, including iOS devices.  \n\n \n\nApplications\n\n * Total apps: This shows the total number of allow listed edtech apps identified by Clever. We’re constantly adding to this list,\n   so you may see the number of apps increase as these are added. Don’t see an app on our list? Let us know so we can add it. \n * Clever apps: Applications that have been added at the district level.\n * Library apps: The total number of Clever Library applications added to Clever Portal by your teachers.\n * Other apps: Show the total number of allow listed Edtech applications not added through Clever, or any weblink—regardless of\n   whether it’s accessed through Clever or not.\n   \n   Each section is clickable so you can view only those specific application categories in the full list underneath. \n   \n   \n\n \n\nApplications - Usage data\n\n * The Students % and Teacher % metrics show the percent of students and teachers using the app, out of the total reported by the\n   Clever Plus extension.\n * Active time per user is the average time a student and teacher is actively using the app during the time range selected on the\n   page (since initial setup, in the last 28 days, in the last 7 days). \n   \n   \n\nIn the example above:\n\n * 984 students and 97 teachers are reported which includes users that are:\n   * synced to Clever\n   * have the Clever Plus extension installed on Chromebooks and/or Windows devices\n   * have been actively using a allow listed Edtech application.\n * 4% of the 984 students and 4% of the 97 teachers used Word Munchers for 10 minutes on average during the current school year.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nBelow are some common questions about EdTech Analytics If you have more questions not answered in this article, please feel free\nto reach out to support!\n \n\nWhat devices and browsers are supported?\n\n * Clever's extension is available for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers. Clever's setup guide provides instructions for\n   Chromebooks and Windows devices using Chrome browsers. While Clever does not currently provide setup guidelines for mobile\n   devices (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.), the extension can report on other types of devices as long as the user is logged into the\n   browser with an email that the district has applied the settings to.\n\n \n\nWhich Identity Providers are supported?\n\n * Your users must be logging into their devices with either Google, ADFS, or Entra ID. We currently do not support devices using\n   LDAPS to authenticate users.\n\n \n\nWhere can I find a copy of Clever's privacy policy?\n\n * In Step 2 of the guide, you'll find the Clever Edtech Analytics Addendum. We also recommend checking out our Trust Center for\n   more information on how Clever handles student data privacy as a whole. \n\n \n\nShould I apply the policies to User and Device OUs?\n\n * Your district can apply the settings to either user or device OUs, and we recommend applying the policies to both.\n\n \n\nHow many users or devices should I set this for?\n\n * We recommend applying this to at least 500 devices or 10% of students. The Edtech Analytics dashboard will not appear until\n   data is collected at that threshold.\n\n \n\nDo I need to complete both guides?\n\n * The first guide is for Chromebooks and the second guide is for Windows Devices. If your district is only using one type of\n   device, then you can skip ahead to complete the guide. \n\n \n\nWhich extension should I delete?\n\n * The Clever Plus extension (ID - dikiaagfielfbnbbopidjjagldjopbpa) provides the functionality for both Saved Passwords and\n   Edtech Analytics. We recommend removing the Clever extension (ID - nopfnnpnopgmcnkjchnlpomggcdjfepo), but having both will not\n   affect the normal user flow.\n\n \n\nCan I export EdTech Analytics data?\n\n * Yes! Data can be exported by clicking Export all data in the top right. Clever does not support the automatic export of EdTech\n   Analytics data (i.e. to a SFTP directory)\n\n\nIf you have any questions about Edtech Analytics, please reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help! \n\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\n * For School Tech Leads: EdTech Analytics\n * Portal Analytics\n * Deploy Edtech Analytics for Edge using Microsoft Intune\n * Deploy Edtech Analytics for Google Chrome using Microsoft Intune"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Filters\n3. Metrics\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAt Clever, we understand how important it is to track application logins and usage for your district users. Using Portal\nAnalytics, district admins have access to graphs and statistics that show how many users are accessing their applications, how\noften they log in, and which schools or apps are being used the most! This article provides a breakdown of the available data, and\nhow it can be filtered.\n \n\n Portal Analytics includes data for all logins powered by Clever, including instant login links.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFILTERS\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the available filters. You can apply different filters to narrow down the usage data and focus on\nspecific users, applications, and school sites. If the selected filters do not apply to a chart, the chart will temporarily be\nhidden.\n\n\n\nTIME & DATE RANGE\n\nYou can filter Portal Analytics by time and date ranges.\n\nClick time range to choose from last 7 days, 28 days, by school year, or Custom dates, which allows for a custom time range any\ntime in the past year. The Export all data button will download data associated with your selected filters. \n\n\n\nChoose start and end date to select a custom date range!\n\n\n\n\nUNITS\n\nSelect whether you'd like to view your data as a percentage (e.g., 75% of all students have logged in), or in absolute terms\n(e.g., 7,500 students have logged in). \n\n\n \n\n\nAPP\n\nSelect All Apps to view login data for all apps connected to your district's Clever account. To look more closely at a specific\napp's usage, select the application from the dropdown. When you select a specific app, the 'Usage by App' graph is disabled.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUSERS, GRADES, AND SCHOOLS\n\nHere you can select whether you want to see usage data for students, teachers, or both.\n \n\n \n\nTo look at the Portal Analytics for specific grade levels, select the grade(s) from the dropdown. Grades are based on student\ngrades, not the grade level for sections or teachers.\n\n * Please note: The teacher filter cannot be used with the grade filter.\n\n\n \n\nTo focus on a specific site instead of All Schools, you can select the school location from the dropdown. Multiple school sites\ncan be selected from the dropdown as well.\n\n * Please note: The Usage by School graph is disabled when you select a single school.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nMETRICS\n\nNow that we know how to use filters to focus on specific areas, let's look at the different measures! The statistics shown are\nbased on the users being shared with the apps. The metrics are not based on the total number of district users in Clever.\n\n \n\n\nUSAGE BY SCOPED USERS\n\n    \n\nUsage by scoped users: This number reflects the number of users shared with the application.\n\n\n \n\n\nUNIQUE USERS\n\n  \n\nUnique users: This number reflects the unique number of shared users who have logged into the application.\n \n\n\n\n\nTOTAL LOGINS\n \n\nTotal Logins: This number reflects the overall number of user logins.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDAILY UNIQUE USERS\n\n\n\n\nDaily unique users: This chart reflects the unique number of users who have logged into an application per day. Hover your mouse\nover a date to see the number of daily unique users for that day.\n\n * Please note: This chart is disabled if you're using the School year to date time frame filter or Custom dates filter.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLOGINS BY APP\n\n\n\n\nLogins by App: This number reflects the number of unique user logins for an individual application. Select the Ascending or\nDescending option to order apps by the number of unique logins.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLOGINS BY SCHOOL\n\n\nLogins by school: This number reflects the number of unique user logins from users at each school site. Select the 'Ascending' or\n'Descending' option to order schools by the number of unique logins.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGIN METHOD / DEVICE / BROWSER\n\n\n\n\nLogin Method: This number reflects the number of unique user logins by login type.

We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM helps districts automate account provisioning and lifecycle management for Microsoft Active Directory services and\nGoogle Workspace. This affordable Clever add-on can create user accounts and organizational units based on data in Clever. Before\nusing this service, however, we recommend making sure your data is in tip-top shape. This article will guide you through a few\nthings to check before starting your IDM journey and some tips to ensure you make the most of it after you're set up. As always,\nif you have any questions, feel free to open a new case in our Help Center.\n\nA note on verbiage - Clever IDM may be confusing if you haven't used an identity management system before. Here's some quick\nlingo: \n\n * Destination - Google Workspace, ADFS, or Entra ID, where Clever IDM will create and manage your users. \n * Formula - the part of your Clever IDM configuration that determines how we create email addresses and OUs This uses\n   \"templates\", or combinations of data or predetermined values, to specify what Clever puts into your destinations. \n * OU (organizational unit) - the \"folder\" of your destinations, a group where users are placed. These can also be managed by\n   Clever IDM!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSET UP YOUR SYNC\n\nYou'll want to ensure that your sync to Clever is up and running before adding IDM to the mix. Everything else in Clever depends\non Secure Sync to work! You can read about Secure Sync in this Help Center article: What is Secure Sync?\n\nThere is a wide variety of sync types available, each with their own set of quirks and advantages. Check out your specific sync\ntype in the list below, and pay close attention to any field limitations or the timings of automated syncs - you may end up\nwanting to schedule IDM to run after your auto sync runs (just let our team know when you'd want IDM to run). \n \n\n * Which sync type should I choose?\n * SFTP\n * Aeries\n * PowerSchool\n * Infinite Campus Auto\n * Infinite Campus API\n * SchoolInsight\n * Skyward API\n * Blackbaud API Sync\n\n\nFor instance, if your sync type does not automatically include student emails, you may want to review our options for populating\nthat field, such as a field mapping. Clever Support is happy to assist you with these mappings. Note that not all sync types\nsupport mappings - you'll want to check out your respective sync type above for details. \n\nNote that Clever IDM can create emails even if the email field isn’t populated by using a template. If you're syncing to Clever’s\nemail field, we'll use that instead of your template.\n\nIn addition to the email address, you'll want to think about getting other data to Clever that you want to sync over - whether\nthese are student lunch numbers, building IDs, or other information you may need to populate in your destination automatically. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDECIDE ON YOUR DESIRED OUTPUT\n\nSay that you want your emails to follow the format below:\n\njohn.smith@clever.k12.edu\n\nYou can accomplish this as your email output in a number of ways. You'll want to decide if you're going to use the sync between\nyour SIS and Clever to give us the email in the email field. If not, you'll want Clever's template to build that format in your\nIDM Configuration page. \n\nRemember that we'll use the email field by default, so if you're syncing the desired email to Clever, you won't need to change\nanything. \n\nYou can start setting up Clever IDM free from your Clever Dashboard. For detailed instructions on the setup process, use the\nfollowing resources:\n \n\n * Clever IDM: Setup for Google and Quick Start - Setting up IDM for Google\n * Clever IDM: Setup for Active Directory and Quick Start - Setting up IDM for Active Directory\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEMAIL NOTIFICATIONS\n\nWeekly IDM Sync Report emails contain key metrics for IDM syncs over the prior week and are sent to the Clever Admin Owner. You\ncan determine the Clever Admin Owner at your district by checking the Role column on the Team Page of your district dashboard.\nDaily sync report emails can be requested by contacting Clever Support. If additional members of your team need access to these\nemailed reports, please have the Clever Admin Owner configure a forwarding filter in their email system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nPLANNING STEPS\n\nAfter you've got your IDM sync up and running, you may want to plan out your long term implementation. For example, if you intend\nto use Clever's Badges into Chromebooks solutions or Badges into Windows solutions, you'll want to ensure you've applied the\nnecessary settings to the OUs or devices where they're required. If you'll be managing your OUs with Clever IDM, think about which\ngroups of students will need access to those solutions, such as K-5.\n \n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Chromebooks - Setup & Troubleshooting\n * Clever Badges: How do I enable Badges into Windows devices?  \n\n\nYou'll also want to disable any other IDM or automated software or scripts that may be running - Clever IDM can't override or\ndisable these other tools, and you may see unintended behavior with multiple types running. Some may work well in tandem, but we'd\nrecommend just using one at a time until you're sure they'll complement each other. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL TOOLS\n\nPassword management can be a pain - so you may consider some of the below to help out: \n\nIf you want your users to have access to password resets within Clever, you may consider checking out our Help Center article on\nthe topic: Single Sign-On (SSO): Active Directory - Password Recovery.\n\nIf you need fine-grained password policies, you may consider checking out this Microsoft Help Center article about AD DS\nFine-Grained Password Policies. You can even use Clever to manage the groups where this would apply. \n\nIf you're running both Entra ID and ADFS but only one instance of Clever IDM, you may consider checking out this Microsoft Help\nCenter article about Entra ID Connect. \n\nGood luck with your implementation, and remember we're here to help! \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nClever IDM: Google Setup\nClever IDM: Active Directory Setup\nClever IDM: Connecting to Active Directory via LDAPS\nClever IDM: Purchasing & Billing\nClever IDM: Sync Reports"

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM helps districts automate account provisioning and lifecycle management for Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Entra\nID, and Google Workspace. This affordable new offering provides school districts with a simple workflow that can be completed in\nminutes to automate organizational unit (OU) and account management directly with Clever. Clever IDM automatically syncs users\nfrom your SIS to Active Directory, Entra ID, or Google daily for an entire year. Your Clever IDM dashboard can be found here.\n\nA full overview of Clever IDM and the setup process can be viewed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP \n\n Click on the following links to find information about:\n• Setting IDM login credentials\n• Organizing OUs \n• Building sub-OUs with the IDM format builder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT TO GOOGLE\n\nIn order to provision accounts, Clever must be granted access to manage the provisioning of users on your domain. The user\nauthorizing the access request must have the ability to grant the following permissions: \n\n * View and manage the provisioning of users on your domain\n * View and manage organization units on your domain\n * View domains related to your customers\n\n    \n \n\nCONNECT TO GOOGLE TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf you encounter either of the following errors (screenshots), please ensure that the Google Account you are connecting to Clever\nis a Super Admin account. Learn more about the Super Admin role in this Google support article.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSELECT CLEVER USERS\n\nClever IDM can provision accounts for students, teachers, and staff. You may select for Clever to provision accounts for one or\nmore of the following:\n\nStudents \nStudents are users that are enrolled as students in educational courses or sections. \n\nTeachers\n\"Teachers\" is the term Clever uses to refer to a district's instructional staff. These are the individuals that are directly\nmanaging a classroom and students.\n\nStaff\n\"Staff\" is the term Clever uses to refer to both non-instructional staff (e.g. secretaries, bus drivers, counselors) and\ninstructional staff that are not directly in charge of a classroom (e.g. school tech leads, instructional coaches, and\nprincipals). These users are often a different employment designation than teachers and may even be managed outside the Student\nInformation System (SIS) in a HR Information System (HRIS)\n \n\nUsers with multiple user roles \nIf a user is assigned to multiple user roles (i.e. Teacher and Staff) in Clever, they will be provisioned a Google account if\neither role is selected for Clever IDM provisioning. If the district chooses to provision accounts for both teachers and staff and\na user is assigned to both teacher and staff roles in Clever, during Clever IDM setup the district will be able to select the\nprimary role to be used for OU and group structure.\n\nUsers with existing Google accounts\nUsers with the same email address in Clever and Google will be matched/organized in the OU structure as outlined in step:\n“Organize Google OUs”. Clever will NOT update the email address for existing Google accounts. To ensure accurate matching, please\nconfirm accurate email addresses are synced to Clever from your student information system (SIS) prior to enabling Clever IDM. \n\n \nAdditionally, Clever IDM allows you to customize which subsets of users that you would like to provision. If you would like to\nfilter by user type, grade, school, or extension field please contact Clever Support so that we can make those adjustments for\nyou.\n \nGraduation rollover date\nIf Clever IDM is set to manage your students, you will be prompted during this step to configure a graduation rollover date. \n \n \n \nIf you do not sync student graduation year directly from your SIS, Clever IDM will use this rollover date to calculate a\ngraduation year for use in formulas. To ensure that this calculation associates your data with the correct school year, set a\ngraduation rollover date. Clever IDM calculates the graduation year based on the student’s synced grade level. Data synced before\nthe graduation rollover date will be associated with the previous school year for graduation year calculations. Data synced after\nthe graduation rollover date will be associated with the upcoming school year for graduation year calculations. Providing a\ngraduation rollover date enables Clever IDM to automatically update any information based on the graduation year (OUs, groups,\netc.) as grade levels change during rollover. If your expected graduation rollover date changes, you can edit the graduation\nrollover date anytime by navigating to your Select Users step in Clever IDM.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDATA WRITTEN TO GOOGLE\n\nThere are two pathways for Clever to set user data in IDM: creation and user modification.\n \n\nCreation\n\nIn the case of user creation, the following fields are synced to Google:\n\n * User first name\n * User last name\n * User type (student, teacher, staff)\n * Primary email address as configured by the district\n * Organizational unit as configured by the district\n * Initial password as configured by the district\n\nAll newly created users are assumed to be unsuspended.\n\nModification\n\nIf a user exists in both Clever and Google data, IDM will optionally update the user. Updates occur when a user's first name, last\nname, user type, or organization unit changes. When updating a user, the following fields are synced:\n\n * User first name (if changed)\n * User last name (if changed)\n * Organizational unit as configured by the district (if changed)\n * Suspension status\n   * Suspended if a user exists in the Google Directory under a managed OU but not in the most recent Clever dataset.\n   * Unsuspended if a user was previously suspended (i.e., not in the Clever dataset) but has been restored in the Clever dataset\n     within 300 days.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about the visibility of these attributes or would like additional attributes to be set by IDM,\nplease contact Clever Support.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDATA WRITTEN TO A STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (SIS)\n\nWe now provide SFTP access to user emails managed by Clever IDM. The SFTP files can be accessed by enabling Participation Reports,\nand the associated SFTP server as described in this article.\nThe CSV files in the SFTP server contain mappings of user emails to their Clever ID, SIS ID, and User Type. Districts can use\nthese files to personally build automation for write back into their SIS on their end. Clever does not support direct SIS write\nback automation outside of the above documentation.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nGROUP MEMBERSHIP \n\nClever IDM can now manage users’ memberships in Google workspace Groups – including both security and distribution groups. Please\nnote that this doesn't create groups.\n\nSetting up\nIn order to set up group membership management, you will need to start by confirming the groups you want managed in Google are\nproperly configured. \n\nAll Clever-managed groups must have unique names. As well, if you want to set up a rule to put users into different groups, the\nrelevant group names must follow the same conventions. For example, if you want a rule set up that will add each user to a group\nfor their school, the relevant groups need to be consistently named – e.g. “Toll Gate Elementary - Students”, “Hopewell Valley\nHigh School - Students”.\n\nIf this isn’t possible for your district, please reach out to let us know. There are some more complicated setups that we can\nsupport.\n\nMembership rules\nWhen you reach out to idm@clever.com to set up group membership management, we’ll ask you for the membership rules you want to\ncreate and the groups you’d like Clever IDM to manage. You can set up one or more membership rules for each user type you\nprovision in IDM.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe summary page will display all the selections made for each user type for both user account settings and organizational\nstructure (OUs). \n\nConfirm that all boxes for the user types that should be provisioned are marked \n\nSelect Preview Google Accounts once all selections have been confirmed. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nPREVIEW AND PROVISION\n\nClever will generate a preview of the number of users that will be created or updated. Additionally, the system will flag any\npotential issues. When the preview is done generating, it is downloadable as a CSV file from the setup guide. \n\nYou can also check on specific accounts that will be created/updated to ensure that they follow the process you'd like, via IDM\nPreview Sync Visualizer. Learn more about IDM Preview Sync Visualizer here.\n\nPurchase Summary\nThe purchase summary will display the estimated total per year for Clever IDM. Please note, this number is subject to change based\non the number of user accounts managed and does not include sales tax. \n\nAfter reviewing the results, select Purchase Clever IDM to proceed to the checkout flow and begin provisioning\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nHow long does setup typically take?\n\n * Setup time depends on the number of students in the district, and the amount of customization required. Smaller accounts with\n   no customization can be set up within 30 minutes, while larger accounts will take longer.\n\n * Implementation varies greatly depending on the overall quality of data in Clever, if additional data is required, the Clever\n   Admin’s access to features at the district such as firewalls, servers, SIS data, etc.\n\nCan I provision for multiple destinations?\n\n * Yes, Clever IDM can be used to provision multiple destinations such as both Google and Active Directory at no additional cost\n   per user.\n\nDoes Clever IDM change anything about my SIS to Clever data sync?\n\n * No, the sync between your SIS and Clever will remain the same. However, email addresses created by Clever IDM will be stored as\n   part of your Clever data.\n\nDoes Clever IDM change anything about existing single sign- on (SSO) access to applications?\n\n * No, SSO access will remain the same. It may run more smoothly with the automated provisioning of user accounts.\n\nCan we maintain our current user email addresses?\n\n * Yes! Work with your IDM Onboarding Specialist to maintain email addresses.\n\nWhen formatting the password in the Clever IDM set-up, is this simply to create new passwords, or will this reset passwords across\nthe entire domain?\n\n * The password format will only be used for new accounts which are provisioned - this will not reset existing passwords.\n\nWill our email addresses and passwords sync back to our SIS?\n\n * No, Clever IDM provides automated syncing only in one direction (from Clever to your destination). You are able to download a\n   CSV file of usernames via the Clever IDM page to upload to your SIS.\n\nDoes Clever IDM automatically calculate Graduation Year for students?\n\n * If synced to Clever, IDM will use the Graduation_year field from your SIS. Otherwise, IDM will automatically calculate\n   Graduation Year for students K-12 based on the student Grade field. In calculating graduation year, PreKindergarten and\n   TransitionalKindergarten will be treated as grade -1.\n\n * Students in the following grade levels will NOT have a Graduation Year unless provided by the district: InfantToddler,\n   Preschool, 13, PostGraduate, Ungraded, Other.\n\nWhat if my question is not answered here?\n\n * Check out our Clever Academy course, Quick Start - Getting started with Clever IDM for Setup FAQs and Troubleshooting FAQs or\n   reach out to Clever Support.\n\nI can’t find the functionality I’m looking for.

Additionally, the system will flag any\npotential issues.\n\nYou can also check on specific accounts that will be created/updated to ensure that they follow the process you'd like, via IDM\nPreview Sync Visualizer. Learn more about IDM Preview Sync Visualizer here.\n\nThe Clever Admin completing the setup guide will receive an email with a CSV summary when the preview is done generating. The CSV\npreview is also downloadable from the setup guide.\n\nMatching\nClever IDM will attempt to match users in one of two ways. First, it will take the user’s Clever username and match it against\nexisting UserPrincipalNames in Active Directory. If a Clever user doesn’t have a username populated, Clever IDM will use the\nUserPrincipalName defined in the “Set login credentials step” and search for identical UserPrincipalNames in Active Directory.\n\nIf there is a matching using either of these methods, Clever will match the user (and perform “Update” events, as necessary). If\nthere is no match, Clever will attempt to create the user, resulting in a “Create” event.\n\nClever tip: for the best matching and preview experience, make sure you’re uploading up-to-date usernames to Clever.\n\nIssues\nThere are a variety of issues that may occur when attempting a first sync. You can view issues by downloading the sync preview\nfiles from your dashboard and viewing the issues file.\n\nMany issues result from Clever attempting to create a user using one or more unique fields (sAMAccountName, UserPrincipalName,\nCommonName, Mail) that already exist on a different account in Active Directory. In most cases, these errors can be resolved by\nupdating usernames in Clever and generating a new preview.\n\nIf your usernames are updated and you’re still encountering issues, please reach out to Clever Support.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nHow long does setup typically take?\n\n * Set up time depends on the number of students in the district, the amount of customization required, and if any errors are\n   encountered with connecting with Active Directory.\n\n * Implementation varies greatly depending on the overall quality of data in Clever, if additional data is required, the Clever\n   Admin’s access to features at the district such as firewalls, servers, SIS data, etc.\n\nCan I provision for multiple destinations?\n\n * Yes, Clever IDM can be used to provision multiple destinations such as both Google and Active Directory at no additional cost\n   per user.\n\nDoes Clever IDM change anything about my SIS to Clever data sync?\n\n * No, the sync between your SIS and Clever will remain the same. However, email addresses created by Clever IDM will be stored as\n   part of your Clever data.\n\nDoes Clever IDM change anything about existing single sign- on (SSO) access to applications?\n\n * No, SSO access will remain the same. It may run more smoothly with the automated provisioning of user accounts.\n\nCan we maintain our current user email addresses?\n\n * Yes! Work with your IDM Onboarding Specialist to maintain email addresses.\n\nWhen formatting the password in the Clever IDM set-up, is this simply to create new passwords, or will this reset passwords across\nthe entire domain?\n\n * The password format will only be used for new accounts which are provisioned - this will not reset existing passwords.\n\nWill our email addresses and passwords sync back to our SIS?\n\n * No, Clever IDM provides automated syncing only in one direction (from Clever to your destination). You are able to download a\n   CSV file of usernames via the Clever IDM page to upload to your SIS.\n\nDoes Clever IDM automatically calculate Graduation Year for students?\n\n * If synced to Clever, IDM will use the Graduation_year field from your SIS. Otherwise, IDM will automatically calculate\n   Graduation Year for students K-12 based on the student Grade field. In calculating graduation year, PreKindergarten and\n   TransitionalKindergarten will be treated as grade -1.\n\n * Students in the following grade levels will NOT have a Graduation Year unless provided by the district: InfantToddler,\n   Preschool, 13, PostGraduate, Ungraded, Other.\n\nWhat if my question is not answered here?\n\n * Check out our Clever Academy course, Quick Start - Getting started with Clever IDM for Setup FAQs and Troubleshooting FAQs or\n   reach out to Clever Support.\n\nI can’t find the functionality I’m looking for. What should I do?\n\n * Reach out to idm@clever.com. The functionality may be available on the back end. If not, we may be able to add new\n   functionality.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated articles: \nClever IDM: Overview\nClever IDM: Google Setup\nClever IDM: Connecting to Active Directory via LDAPS\nClever IDM: Purchasing & Billing\nClever IDM: Sync Reports\n\nClever IDM: Summer Rollover\nClever IDM: Active Directory Group Membership Management\nClever IDM: Formulas\nClever IDM: Account links\nClever IDM: Setting login credentials\nClever IDM: Organizing OUs"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Connection Steps\n3. Final Connection Test\n4. Common Errors\n5. FAQs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM uses LDAPS to establish a connection with your district’s Active Directory instance. LDAPS is different from LDAP and\nrequires different configurations at the firewall and server levels (learn more about the differences here). This article outlines\nthe steps you can take to set up your LDAPS connection and can help you troubleshoot any issues you might encounter during that\nprocess.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, email us at Clever Support.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONNECTION STEPS\n\nTo provision accounts, Clever needs permission to connect to your Active Directory server. To establish a successful connection\nwith Clever, you will need to provide the following information for your Active Directory server:\n\n * LDAPS URL\n * SHA-256 fingerprints of AD server’s SSL certificate\n * Username and password for a bind account\n * Base Distinguished Name (Base DN)\n\nIn addition to providing the information above, if you use a firewall please give access to the Clever external IP addresses\n(54.241.134.131, 50.18.217.135, 54.241.154.41) on port 636 to ensure a successful connection with your server. Also please ensure\nyour firewall reroutes Clever to a domain controller for your Active Directory with write access.\n \n\n\nPROVIDING THE LDAPS URL\n\nAn LDAPS URL lets Clever know where to look when trying to connect with your Active Directory server. It is a URL that starts with\n“ldaps://” and ends with your server’s external IP address or domain name.\n \nTo provide the LDAPS URL for your server:\n\n 1. Locate your server’s external IP address or domain name. We recommend using your IP address. To find your IP address do one of\n    the following:\n    * Google “What is my IP address?” -or-\n    * Go to the “Server Manager” application on your Windows device and navigate to “All Servers”, where you will see the IP\n      addresses listed for all of your servers.\n 2. Copy your server’s IP address.\n 3. Paste your server’s IP address into the LDAPS URL input in step 2 of the Connect to Active Directory setup. \n\n\n 4. Click “Test connection”\n 5. If the connection to the LDAPS server is successful, click “Next step”.\n    If there is an error connecting to the LDAPS server, please ensure you have:\n    Entered your LDAPS URL following proper formatting (e.g. “ldaps://123.123.123.123” or “ldaps://district.org”)\n    Given access through your firewall to Clever’s external IP addresses (54.241.134.131, 50.18.217.135, 54.241.154.41) over port\n    636 and try again. Also please ensure your firewall reroutes Clever to a domain controller for your Active Directory with\n    write access.\n\n \n\n\nPROVIDING THE SHA-256 FINGERPRINTS OF YOUR SERVER’S SSL CERTIFICATE\nYOUR SERVER’S SSL CERTIFICATE ESTABLISHES A SECURE, ENCRYPTED CONNECTION BETWEEN CLEVER AND YOUR ACTIVE DIRECTORY SERVER, WHICH\nKEEPS YOUR DATA SAFE. THE FINGERPRINT IS A HASH OF YOUR SSL CERTIFICATE, WHICH SAFELY STORES ALL OF THE CERTIFICATE’S DATA.\n\nTo provide the SHA-256 fingerprints of your server’s SSL certificate:\n\n 1. Click “Add fingerprint” in step 3 of the Connect to Active Directory step. If you already have a fingerprint, you'll need to\n    remove it and add a new one.\n 2. Clever will automatically download the SHA-256 fingerprints of your server’s SSL certificate. Click “Add fingerprint” once\n    your fingerprints have been downloaded.\n 3. You will now see the added fingerprint in the “Certificate fingerprints” table. If you would like to add additional\n    certificate fingerprints, contact idm@clever.com.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPROVIDING A BIND ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD WITH READ AND WRITE ACCESS\nTHE BIND ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD ARE USED TO REQUEST AUTHENTICATION WHEN PERFORMING SEARCHES ON YOUR ACTIVE DIRECTORY\nSERVER. CLEVER NEEDS ACCESS TO A BIND ACCOUNT WITH READ AND WRITE PERMISSIONS TO SUCCESSFULLY PROVISION ACCOUNTS.\n\nTo apply the necessary permissions on your bind account:\n\n 1. Go to the “Active Directory Users and Computers” application on your Windows device and select your server’s top level domain.\n 2. Click the “Action” menu then click “Properties”.\n 3. Click the “Security” tab in the Properties window.\n 4. If you don’t see your bind account user listed in the “Group or user names” menu, click “Add…” If you do see your bind account\n    user listed, skip to step 6.\n 5. Type the name of your bind account user and click “OK”. In this case, we have named our bind account “Bind Account”, but yours\n    may be named something else.\n 6. You should now see your bind account selected at the top of the “Group or user names” menu.\n 7. Click “Advanced” to open the advanced security settings window.\n 8. In the “Permission entries” menu, double-click your bind account user.\n 9. In the “Permissions” menu, click the checkbox next to:\n    * List contents\n    * Read all properties\n    * Write all properties\n    * Read permissions\n    * All validated writes\n    * All extended rights\n    * Create all child objects\n    * Delete all child objects\n    * Delete\n       \n\nNOTE: Once you have applied the necessary permissions to your bind account, please ensure your server configuration allows\nClever’s simple bind authentication method. Learn more about allowing simple bind authentication here.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo provide your bind account username and password:\n\n 1. Go to the “Active Directory Users and Computers” application on your Windows device and select your bind account user (this is\n    typically found in the “Users” or “Administrators” OUs).\n 2. Click the “Action” menu and select “Properties”\n 3. Click the “Account” tab\n 4. Write the full expression of the “User logon name” in the “Bind account username” field in step 4 of the Connect to Active\n    Directory step. In this case, the Bind account username is “bind-account@test-ad.clever-idm.com”.\n 5. Write your bind account password in the “Bind account password” field. Passwords in Active Directory are stored using\n    encrypted hashes and the method of storing passwords will be specific to your server configuration. If you don’t know your\n    bind account password, please contact your network administrator or read this article to learn more about how passwords are\n    stored in Active Directory.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nPROVIDING THE BASE DISTINGUISHED NAME (BASE DN)\n\nTHE BASE DN IS THE STARTING POINT WHEN PERFORMING A SEARCH ON YOUR ACTIVE DIRECTORY SERVER. CLEVER WILL USE THE BASE DN TO\nNAVIGATE YOUR SERVER’S DATA.\n\nTo provide the Base DN for your server:\n\n 1. Go to the “Active Directory Users and Computers” application on your Windows device and select your server’s top level domain.\n 2. Click the “Action” menu and select “Properties”\n 3. Click the “Attribute Editor” tab\n 4. Scroll down to the “distinguishedName” attribute\n 5. Write the “distinguishedName” value in the “Base DN” field in step 5 of the Connect to Active Directory step. In this case,\n    the Base DN is “DC=test-ad,DC=clever-idm,DC=com”\n\nNOTE: Your Base DN should be the same domain used in your bind account username, but written in Domain Controller, or “DC”,\nformat. In this case, the domain used in the bind account username was “@test-ad.clever-idm.com” so the DC format for the Base DN\nwould be “DC=test-ad,DC=clever-idm,DC=com”.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFINAL CONNECTION TEST\n\nOnce you have completed all of the connection steps, you will be asked to run a final connection test to ensure everything is\nworking as expected. If the test is successful, you can save your Active Directory connection configuration and proceed to the\nnext step: Select users. If you encounter an error during the final connection test, the error message will explain what has\nhappened and redirect you to the specific part of the connection step that needs attention.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON ERRORS\n\nHere are three common errors that might come up when Connecting to Active Directory via LDAPS:\n\n * LDAPS URL failing to connect\n * Bind account authentication was unsuccessful\n * Could not perform a search with the Base DN\n * Connection errors during first sync\n\n \n\n\nLDAPS URL FAILING TO CONNECT\n\nIn general, this error means that Clever IDM wasn’t able to find an AD server with an SSL certificate at the URL provided. There\nare a variety of different reasons that can happen. \n\n\n\n1. Double-check your LDAPS URL. \nIf you use a firewall, make sure that the URL provided is your external URL. If you’re using your hostname, try your public IP\naddress instead. You can find your public address by using a site like this.\n\n2. Check your firewall settings\nConfirm that you have allowed traffic from Clever’s external IP addresses on port 636:\n54.241.134.131\n50.18.217.135\n54.241.154.41\nAlso, ensure your firewall reroutes Clever to a domain controller for your Active Directory server with write access.\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed the above, use the test connection button in Clever and monitor your network traffic within your firewall to\nsee if there’s any activity from our IP addresses. If not, revisit the earlier steps to ensure you have the right LDAPS URL and\nthat Clever’s IP addresses are allowed through your firewall over port 636.\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that Clever is making it through your firewall, check the policies you’ve applied to redirect traffic from\nClever to the appropriate AD server in your network.\n\n3. Confirm your AD server has an SSL certificate\nIf you’ve made it this far, but are still hitting the “connection unsuccessful” error in Clever, it’s possible that your AD server\ndoesn’t have an appropriate SSL certificate. You can learn more about setting up LDAPS and applying an SSL certificate to your\nserver in this article: Step-by-Step Guide to Setup LDAPS on Windows Server.\n \n\n\nBIND ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION WAS UNSUCCESSFUL\n\nThis error indicates that Clever IDM is unable to log in using the bind account credentials provided. \n\n\n\nThe most common causes of this error are: \n\n 1. The username and password are invalid (meaning that either the username or password were not typed in correctly. To resolve\n    this issue, read more here.\n 2. Your server is not configured to allow Clever’s simple bind account method. To resolve this issue, read more here.\n 3. You have not provided read and write permissions on the bind account. To resolve this issue, read more here.\n 4. The domain used for the bind account username and the Base DN don’t match (with the bind account username using domain format\n    and the Base DN using Domain Controller, or “DC”, format). To resolve this issue, read more here.\n\n \n\n\nCOULD NOT PERFORM A SEARCH WITH THE BASE DN\n\nThis error indicates that Clever has successfully logged in using the provided bind account credentials, but is not able to\nperform a search on your server using the provided Base DN. \n\n\nThe most common causes of this error are: \n\n 1. Your Base DN was not entered following Domain Controller, or “DC”, format. To resolve this issue, read more here.\n 2. You have not provided read and write permissions on the bind account. Although the bind account credentials may have been\n    valid, and thus Clever could successfully log into the bind account, a search cannot be performed on the server using the Base\n    DN because read permissions have not been provided. To resolve this issue, read more here.\n 3. The domain used for the bind account username and the Base DN don’t match (with the bind account username using domain format\n    and the Base DN using Domain Controller, or “DC”, format). To resolve this issue, read more here.\n\nExamples of acceptable Base DNs:\n\n * DC=testdistrict,DC=local\n * DC=abc,DC=com\n * DC=clever,DC=k12,DC=com\n\nCommon mistakes in this step include:\n\n * Not including DC=local, DC=org, etc. in the Base DN\n * Including the parent OUs or CN of the BIND account used (these should not be included).\n\n \n\n\nCONNECTION ERRORS DURING FIRST SYNC\n\nThe most common connection error that a district may see after the connect step is during the first attempted sync. If a sync\npreview shows very few issues, but the first attempted sync results in many more, it’s likely that IDM’s BIND account doesn’t have\nappropriate write access. In the issues CSV, these errors could look like:\n\n * LDAP Result Code 34 “Invalid DN Syntax”: 00000057: LdapErr: DSID-0C090C4D, comment: Error in attribute conversion operation,\n   data 0, v2580\n   * Check that the BIND account has write access. To resolve this issue, read more here.\n * LDAP Result Code 50 \"\"Insufficient Access Rights\"\": 00002098: SecErr: DSID-0315130D, problem 4003 (INSUFF_ACCESS_RIGHTS), data\n   0\n   * This means that the Clever Bind Account does not have the permissions to make the changes its being directed to. Try these\n     three troubleshooting steps:\n     1. Check that the Clever bind account has the permissions outlined in this section.\n        Ensure that for all OUs/Users that Clever IDM will manage have inheritable permissions\n        Go into OUs that our IDM users are in and make sure that “Disable Inheritance” is not checked in the settings\n     2. Ensure that your OUs are are not set to “protect from accidental deletion”\n        * Please check spot check users to see if they’re inheriting permissions. Tip: you can use a powershell script to enable\n          this for all users without having to do it manually.  \n     3. Go into OUs that our IDM users are in and make sure that “protect from accidental deletion” is not checked on the objects\n        tab and ensure that there are no “deny” permissions set as the top level permission in that OU.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\n\nWHY DO YOU USE LDAPS INSTEAD OF LDAP TO CONNECT TO MY AD INSTANCE?\n\nData sent via LDAPS is encrypted in transit, making it a more secure option than LDAP. Clever considers the data it manages\n(including the BIND credentials provided by districts) to be highly sensitive and, as such, uses the most secure option available\nfor establishing a connection with local Active Directory servers.\n \n\n\nIS CLEVER’S CONNECTION TO MY ACTIVE DIRECTORY INSTANCE SECURE?\n\nClever IDM uses a bind account to sync with the destination AD server. The district gives the bind account the minimum permissions\nneeded -- read/write users + org units (as well as \"replicating directory changes\" permission to read the latest changes). Clever\nIDM for AD uses a standard LDAPS package and is limited to these operations: create/update/archive users, create org units. \n\nClever IDM is not able to make any other changes, such as policy changes or domain configuration changes. Internal employees are\nnot able to view plaintext bind account credentials. \n\nYou can read more about Clever’s security practices here.\n\nRelated articles: \nClever IDM: Overview\nClever IDM: Active Directory Setup\nClever IDM: Purchasing & Billing\nClever IDM: Sync Reports"

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\nPlease note: Microsoft has changed the name of Azure to Entra ID. We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM helps districts automate account provisioning and lifecycle management for Microsoft Active Directory, Google\nWorkspace, and Entra ID. This affordable new offering provides school districts with a simple workflow that can be completed in\nminutes to automate account management directly with Clever. Clever IDM automatically syncs users from your SIS to Entra ID,\nActive Directory, and/or Google daily for an entire year. Your Clever IDM dashboard can be found here.\n\n\nA full overview of the Clever IDM setup process is below. If you haven’t already purchased Clever IDM, you'll be asked to purchase\nafter completing the setup process. More information on pricing and purchasing can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP\n\nPlease note: Click on the following link to find information about Setting IDM login credentials.\n\n\n\nCONNECT TO ENTRA ID \n\nTo provision accounts, Clever must be granted access to manage the provisioning of users on your Entra ID domain. The user\nauthorizing the access request must have admin access to the relevant Entra ID instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT CLEVER USERS \n\nClever IDM can provision accounts for students, teachers, and staff. You can select for Clever to provision accounts for one or\nmore of the following:\n\n * Students \n   * Students are users that are enrolled as students in educational courses or sections.  \n * Teachers\n   * Teachers is the term Clever uses to refer to a district's instructional staff. These are the individuals that are directly\n     managing a classroom and students.\n * Staff\n   * Staff is the term Clever uses to refer to both non-instructional staff (e.g., secretaries, bus drivers, counselors) and\n     instructional staff that are not directly in charge of a classroom (e.g., school tech leads, instructional coaches, and\n     principals).\n\nThese users are often a different employment designation than teachers and may even be managed outside the Student Information\nSystem (SIS) in an HR Information System (HRIS)\n\n \n\nUsers with multiple user roles\nIf a user is assigned to multiple user roles (i.e., Teacher and Staff) in Clever, they will be provisioned an Entra ID account if\neither role is selected for Clever IDM provisioning. If the district chooses to provision accounts for both teachers and staff and\na user is assigned to both teacher and staff roles in Clever, during Clever IDM setup the district will be able to select the\nprimary role to be referenced.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, Clever IDM allows you to customize which subsets of users that you would like to provision. If you would like to\nfilter by user type, grade, school, or extension field, please contact Clever Support so that we can make those adjustments for\nyou.\n\n \n\nGraduation rollover date\nIf Clever IDM is set to manage your students, you will be prompted during this step to configure a graduation rollover date. \n\n\n\nIf you do not sync student graduation year directly from your SIS, Clever IDM will use this rollover date to calculate a\ngraduation year for use in formulas. To ensure that this calculation associates your data with the correct school year, set a\ngraduation rollover date. Clever IDM calculates the graduation year based on the student’s synced grade level. Data synced before\nthe graduation rollover date will be associated with the previous school year for graduation year calculations. Data synced after\nthe graduation rollover date will be associated with the upcoming school year for graduation year calculations. Providing a\ngraduation rollover date enables Clever IDM to automatically update any information based on the graduation year (OUs, groups,\netc.) as grade levels change during rollover. If your expected graduation rollover date changes, you can edit the graduation\nrollover date anytime by navigating to your Select Users step in Clever IDM.\n\n\nDATA WRITTEN TO ENTRA ID \n\nThere are two pathways for Clever to set user data in IDM: creation and user modification. \n \nCreation\nIn the case of user creation, the following fields are synced to Entra ID:\n\n * User first name\n * User last name\n * User type (student, teacher, staff)\n * UserPrincipalName as configured by the district\n * Primary email address as configured by the district\n * Initial password as configured by the district\n * Any custom fields configured by the district\n * All newly created users are assumed to be unsuspended.\n\n\nModification\nIf a user exists in both Clever and Entra ID data, IDM will optionally update the user. When updating a user, the following fields\nare synced:\n\n * User first name (if changed)\n * User last name (if changed)\n * Email address (if changed)\n * District-configured custom fields (if changed)\n * Suspension status\n   * Suspended if a user exists in Entra ID, but not in the most recent Clever dataset.\n   * Unsuspended if a user was previously suspended (i.e., not in the Clever dataset), but has been restored in the Clever\n     dataset.\n\n \n\nPlease note: If you have questions or comments about the visibility of these attributes or would like additional attributes to be\nset by IDM, please contact idm@clever.com.\n\n \n \n\n\nDATA WRITTEN TO A STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (SIS) \n\nWe now provide SFTP access to user emails managed by Clever IDM. The SFTP files can be accessed by enabling Participation Reports,\nand the associated SFTP server as described in this article.\n\nThe CSV files in the SFTP server contain mappings of user emails to their Clever ID, SIS ID, and User Type. Districts can use\nthese files to personally build automation for write-back into their SIS on their end. Clever does not support direct SIS\nwrite-back automation outside of the above documentation.\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY \n\nThe summary page will display all the selections made for each user type for user account settings. \nConfirm that all boxes for the user types that should be provisioned are marked completed.\n\nClick Preview Entra ID Accounts once all selections have been confirmed. \n\n\n\n\n\nPREVIEW AND PROVISION \n\nClever will generate a preview of the number of users that will be created or updated. Additionally, the system will flag any\npotential issues.\n\nYou can also check on specific accounts that will be created/updated to ensure that they follow the process you'd like, via IDM\nPreview Sync Visualizer. Learn more about IDM Preview Sync Visualizer here.\n\nThe Clever Admin completing the setup guide will receive an email with a CSV summary when the preview is done generating. The CSV\npreview is also downloadable from the setup guide. \n\nPurchase Summary\nThe purchase summary will display the estimated total per year for Clever IDM. Please note this number is subject to change based\non the number of user accounts managed and does not include sales tax. \n\nAfter reviewing the results, select Purchase Clever IDM to proceed to the checkout flow and begin provisioning. More information\non purchasing here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\nHow do I add users to groups in Entra ID?\n\n * We recommend using Entra ID’s dynamic group functionality to manage group membership. When used in tandem with Clever IDM’s\n   ability to write to any field in Entra ID, dynamic groups offer a simple, powerful way to maintain groups for students and\n   staff. If dynamic groups don’t meet your needs, please contact idm@clever.com.\n\nHow do I add licenses for new users in Entra ID Active Directory?\n\n * Entra ID’s dynamic group functionality allows you to not only manage group membership but apply certain licenses to any group\n   members automatically. We recommend that you create one dynamic group for each of the different license types you have and use\n   Clever IDM to populate a field in Entra ID to differentiate between the users that should receive those different licenses\n   (e.g., writing “student” or “staff” to the employeeType field). \n\nWhat if I don’t want Clever IDM to manage a user in Entra ID?\n\n * We have some functionality that allows you to prevent Clever IDM from archiving users. If you’re interested in that\n   functionality or something else, please contact idm@clever.com.\n\nDoes Clever IDM automatically calculate Graduation Year for students?\n\n * If synced to Clever, IDM will use the Graduation_year field from your SIS. Otherwise, IDM will automatically calculate\n   Graduation Year for students K-12 based on the student Grade field. In calculating graduation year, PreKindergarten and\n   TransitionalKindergarten will be treated as grade -1.\n * Students in the following grade levels will NOT have a Graduation Year unless provided by the district: InfantToddler,\n   Preschool, 13, PostGraduate, Ungraded, Other.\n\nI can’t find the functionality I’m looking for. What should I do?\n\n * Reach out to idm@clever.com. The functionality may be available on the back end. If not, we may be able to add new\n   functionality.\n\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\nClever IDM: Overview\nClever IDM: Google Setup\nClever IDM: Active Directory Setup\nClever IDM: Purchasing & Billing\nClever IDM: Sync Reports\nClever IDM: Summer Rollover\nClever IDM: Account links"

FAQs\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW \n\nClever IDM allows you to manage accounts in on-premise Active Directory, Entra ID, and Google Workspace simultaneously.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nADDING ADDITIONAL DESTINATIONS\n\nIf you haven’t started setting Clever IDM up yet, please visit this article. Once you have your first destination set up, you can\nadd another destination by simply clicking the Add new destination button on your Clever IDM homepage:\n\n\n \n\nAfter adding an additional destination, you can start configuring it. For guidance on setting up the new destination, see Clever\nIDM: Active Directory Setup, Clever IDM: Entra ID (Azure) Setup, or Clever IDM: Google Setup.\n\nOf note, each destination will be set up independently, meaning that you can use the same credential and OU conventions or\ndifferent ones – depending on the setup that works best for you.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMANAGING MULTIPLE ACTIVE DESTINATIONS\n\nOnce Clever IDM is syncing with multiple destinations, you’ll see them each as cards on your Clever IDM homepage. The cards\ncontain summary metrics from your most recent sync. To view more about a destination, click the card to see the relevant tasks,\nreports, and more. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQS\n\nCan we manage different sets of users for each destination?\n\n * Yes. Clever IDM allows you to configure each destination independently, so you can select whichever user types you’d like to be\n   managed for each destination. If you’d like to filter down users by school or grade level for a given destination, reach out\n   to idm@clever.com, and we can help.\n\nCan we keep the passwords the same across multiple destinations?\n\n * Clever IDM will set passwords based on your chosen convention whenever accounts are created. Clever IDM also supports random\n   passwords across multiple destinations. Once one destination is configured, you’ll see the option to use that destination’s\n   password in other destinations.\n * School districts using Clever IDM can also enable recovery and reset functionality for any connected destinations.\n   \n    \n   \n   \n * Once accounts are created, passwords can be managed via Clever. See this article on how to do so: Clever Admin: Account\n   recovery and password reset.\n\n\n\nDoes it cost more to add multiple destinations?\n\n * No! Clever IDM charges based on the total number of managed users, regardless of how many destinations we manage. The only case\n   where adding another destination will increase the cost of Clever IDM is if you use the new destination to manage users that\n   aren’t already being managed by the first destination you configured.\n\nCan I add two different destinations of the same type?\n\n * We support multiple destinations of the same type, e.g., you can use Clever IDM to sync users to two or more Active Directory,\n   Entra ID, or Google Workspaces servers. If you’re interested in this feature, reach out to idm@clever.com.\n\nI use Google Directory sync and Google Password sync to keep my AD and Google in sync. Should I still keep that running if I set\nup IDM for both?\n\n * Clever IDM will manage users and their placement in OUs in Google. If those are the only things you use Google Directory Sync\n   to manage in Google Workspace, running it in tandem with Clever IDM is unnecessary.\n * If there are other elements, like Groups or Passwords, that you use Google Directory Sync to keep in sync between AD and\n   Google, we recommend you continue to use GDS alongside Clever IDM. Ensure you only use GDS to sync the data Clever IDM isn’t\n   already managing.\n\nIf you still need support or have additional questions, please reach out to support.clever.com."

Supported field names\n6. Complex modifications\n7. Random password custom formulas\n7. Using the forEach function\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will walk you through common operations that you can use to manipulate data in Clever to create formulas for Clever\nIDM. These allow you to build a format for many different products in Clever - from IDM email addresses to SSO (Saved Passwords)\napplication credentials and many other places in the Clever Dashboard.\n\nThese formulas work all across Clever - so if you’re setting up Clever IDM for Google, Active Directory, or even Entra ID, you’ll\nstill be able to transform data into the format you need!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBUILDING FORMULAS\n\nEasily tailor formulas with Clever IDM's format builder. This intuitive tool guides you through crafting formats for IDM fields\nlike sub-OUs and login credentials. Choose between the standard block builder for simplicity or the advanced format editor for\nmore customization.\n\nPlease note: The block builder approach for building formats doesn’t currently support extension fields or advanced use of\nfunctions. If you need to use your extension fields or write more complex functions that you know Clever supports but don’t see as\nan option, you’ll need to use the advanced option of entering a format string. See the Complex modifications for assistance with\nformat strings.  \n\n\n\nClick use the advanced format editor to access the advanced format string format.\n\n \n\nClever Tip: Dark purple SIS variables, such as School Name (as shown above), indicate a field that is required in your sync. Light\npurple SIS variables, such as Graduation Year, indicate that they're an optional variable that is not required in  your sync. If\nyou use an optional variable and don't sync data for that field for all users, any user who doesn't have that data populated shows\nas an error and won't sync successfully.\n\n\nADD AN SIS VARIABLE\n\nThis option allows you to select from the available fields that you are syncing to Clever. \n\n\n\n\nADD CUSTOM TEXT\n\nThis option allows you to type out custom text that you would like to use in your formula.\n\n\n\n\nADD A FUNCTION\n\nThis option allows you to use functions to build a formula. For more context on how to use functions, review Common Operations. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON OPERATIONS\n\n \n\nClever Tip: Copy these formats from this article and directly paste them in the IDM setup for your email or password format.

They are:\n     * U = uppercase character\n     * L = lowercase character\n     * D = digit\n     * S = symbol\n   * For example, if you wanted a four-letter random password that is only upper and lower-case characters, you’d use\n     {{randomString 4 “UL”}}\n   * Clever will automatically remove ambiguous characters [zero, uppercase \"O\", one, uppercase \"i\" and lowercase \"ell\"] for any\n     character type combinations containing \"UL\", \"UD\", or \"LD\"\n     * Character type combinations that don't contain any ambiguous sets will use all available characters. For example: \"DS\"\n       random strings include zero and one.\n * {{randomWord}} or {{randomUpperWord}}  \n   * The randomWord function randomly selects a 4-5 letter word from a kid-friendly dictionary.\n   * The randomUpperWord function selects from the same dictionary but capitalizes the first letter. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nUSING THE FOREACH FUNCTION\n\nThe forEach function allows you to assign multiple groups to a single user based on a single group rule. This functionality is\nonly available in the group membership management step of the Clever IDM setup wizard. The forEach function will iterate over a\nselected array of values associated with a user and apply a format to each value in that array. The selected array can either be:\n\n \n\n 1. Schools associated with a user\n\n 2. Sections associated with a user\n\n 3. A space-delimited string where each element of the \"array\" is URL encoded\n\n \n\nThis functionality is available in Clever IDM’s basic format builder. We recommend trying to set up a forEach rule using the basic\nformat builder first.\n\n \n\n\nUSING FOREACH IN THE ADVANCED FORMAT BUILDER\n\nIf you need more customization, you can do so via the advanced format builder. Take the example format: {{forEach \"s\" schools\n\"%7B%7Bs.name%7D%7D\"}}. This format would look through each school associated with a user and place them in a group that matches\nthe school’s name. The forEach function is accepting three arguments:\n\n \n\n 1. The first argument, \"s\" in this instance, is the name we assign the variable\n\n 2. The second argument, schools, is the array that we’d like to use\n\n 3. The final argument, \"%7B%7Bs.name%7D%7D\", is the format to apply to each value in the array\n\nPlease note: The final argument in the format must be URL encoded. URL encoding replaces special characters and spaces with codes.\nFor example, “%20” encodes a \"space\" and “%7B” encodes the left curly bracket character \"{\". URL encoding allows the format\nbuilder to interpret the format correctly in all cases.   \n\n \n\nThe final argument can also use other IDM-compatible functions. An example using the required URL encoding for a format where we\nwant to put users in groups that are a combination of their school name and “Staff” would look like this: {{forEach \"s\" schools\n\"%7B%7Bconcat%20s.name%20%22Staff%22%7D%7D\"}}.\n\n \n\nPlease contact Support.Clever.com if you need additional help with custom formats."

Building sub-OUs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will help guide you with how Clever IDM organizes users into your existing Active Directory or Google OU structures,\nwhich is part of the IDM setup process. The organization of these is very similar for both destinations, Active Directory and\nGoogle.\n\n\nYou can find the general setup for each destination type here:\n\n * Clever IDM: Google Setup\n * Clever IDM: Active Directory Setup\n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nORGANIZE OUS\n\nOU stands for organizational unit, and it’s simply a group that an administrator can create in Active Directory or the Google\nAdmin console to apply settings to a specific set of users, like students or 7th graders.\n\nClever IDM will organize users into your existing OU structure and create optional sub-OUs based on Clever user data. A preview\nwill populate, displaying the resulting OU structure as selections are made. \n\n \n\n\nPARENT OU\n\nSelect the primary OU where all users for the user type should reside. In the next step, the school district can identify which\nsub-OUs Clever should create to organize students. \nThe following OUs are required for Google and Active Directory:\n\n * Parent OU for student users\n * Parent OU for teacher users\n * Parent OU for staff users\n * Parent OU for archived users\n\n\n\nSUB-OUS\n\nClever can create sub-OUs to organize users based on data in Clever, such as school, grade level, and graduation year. Please note\nthat sub-OUs are not required.\n\nHere are a few popular options: \n\nStudent sub-OUs:\n\n * {School}\n * {School} > {Grade}\n * {School} > {Graduation year}\n * {Grade}\n * {Graduation year}\n\n Graduation Year:  If synced to Clever, IDM will use the Graduation_year field from the school district's SIS. Otherwise, IDM will\nautomatically calculate Graduation Year for students K-12 based on the student Grade field. In calculating graduation year,\nPreschool, PreKindergarten, and TransitionalKindergarten will be treated as grade -1. Kindergarten is treated as 0.\n\n \n\nStudents in the following grade levels will NOT have a Graduation Year unless provided by the school district: InfantToddler, 13,\nPostGraduate, Ungraded, Other.\n\nTeacher sub-OUs:\n\n * {School} \n\nStaff sub-OUs:\n\n * {Department}\n * {Job code}\n * {custom formula}\n\nClever recommends implementing sub-OUs to assist with organization and permissions. \n\n\nARCHIVE OUS\n\nClever allows the school district to determine the parent OU where a user should be placed when an account is removed from Clever.\nIf a user is removed from Clever, they will be placed in the Archive OU during the next Clever IDM sync.\n\nIf a user returns to Clever within one year of departure and is in an Archive OU:\n\n * If a user returns to Clever within one year of departure and is in an Archive OU, their Clever account will be restored and\n   their account moved from the Archive OU to the appropriate active OU based on your Parent/Sub-OU settings\n * A new Clever and Active Directory or Google account will be generated if a user returns after one year. \n\nHow Clever IDM protects against the accidental archiving of multiple users by detecting unusual behavior:\n\n 1. We calculate the percentage of total users being marked to be archived for each user type (e.g., students, teachers, and\n    staff).\n 2. If this percentage exceeds 20%, the archive will be placed on an automatic pause, and Clever admins will receive a\n    notification.\n 3. This notification will be visible in the IDM dashboard under the Tasks section\n 4. Clever Admins review the users to determine whether or not they should be archived.\n\n\n\nIGNORED OUS\n\nIgnored OUs are OUs in your destination (Active Directory and Google) you want Clever to ignore. Users won’t be moved out of these\nOUs and will be managed manually by the district. Ignored OUs are often used to impart more rigorous controls, such as applying\nsettings for specific individuals or groups of users (for example you might have an ignored OU for users that blocks YouTube).\nMultiple OUs can be selected!\n\nBy default, Clever IDM will deactivate accounts once users are removed from Clever – unless they are within an ignored OU. The\ndefault behavior for users in ignored OUs is to fully ignore those accounts. However, you can update this behavior as outlined\nbelow.\n\nClever IDM offers three options for student, teacher, and staff accounts in ignored OUs, giving you more flexibility. These\noptions are available in the Organize OUs step of the IDM Provisioning Setup:\n\n * Automatically suspend user accounts in ignored OUs when they’re removed from Clever.\n   * Clever IDM will update user accounts with this setting.\n * Don’t automatically suspend user accounts in ignored OUs when they’re removed from Clever.\n   * You’ll suspend these user accounts.\n * Don’t match, update, or suspend users in ignored OUs. I will manage these user accounts myself.\n   * You’ll handle all updates for users in ignored OUs. \n     \n      \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBUILDING SUB-OUS\n\nClever IDM can support OU modifications, which allow you to organize users based on data in Clever. The IDM format builder walks\nyou through the steps to create formats for sub-OUs. To learn more about using the format builder, please review our Clever IDM:\nFormulas article.\n\n \n\nTo access the format builder for Clever IDM:\n\n 1. Click on the Organize OUs step in the provisioning setup for Google or Active Directory.\n 2. Click Edit in the OU for which you want to create a format.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n 3. Click Next step in the blue box on the bottom right to get to the Build your format step.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n 4. Click Build your format to create sub-OUs. To learn more about your options with building a format, review our Clever IDM:\n    Formulas article.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n 5. You’ll have several options to build a format:\n    1. Block builder\n       1. Use a premade sub-OU format (can be edited)\n       2. Build a sub-OU format using blocks\n    2. Enter a format string (Advanced)\n       \n        \n 6. On the right, you can preview the data. If the format looks correct, click Save format.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n\nPlease note: The block builder approach for building formats doesn’t currently support extension fields or advanced use of\nfunctions. If you need to use your extension fields or write more complex functions that you know Clever supports but don’t see as\nan option, you’ll need to use the advanced option of entering a format string.  See the Clever IDM: Formulas Help Center article\nfor assistance with format strings.\n\n \n\nIf an error occurs with your format, you can view it in the red error box:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\n * Clever IDM: Google Setup\n * Clever IDM: Active Directory Setup\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview  \n2. Prerequisites\n3. Configuration\n4. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article describes the group membership management functionality available in Clever IDM. This functionality is only available\nto Clever IDM subscribers who have configured Clever IDM with Active Directory or Google.\n\nClever IDM can create, update, and archive users in your Active Directory or Google Workspace instances. In addition, Clever IDM\ncan now manage these users’ memberships in groups – including both security and mailing (or distribution) groups.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPREREQUISITES\n\nIn order to set up group membership management, you will need to start by confirming the groups you want managed are properly\nconfigured.\n\nAll Clever-managed groups must have unique names. \n\nAlso, if you want to set up a rule to put users into different groups, the relevant group names must follow the same conventions.\nFor example, if you want a rule set up that will add each user to a group for their school, the relevant groups need to be\nconsistently named – e.g. “Toll Gate Elementary - Students”, “Hopewell Valley High School - Students.\"\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nYou can configure your group membership in your IDM setup under the Configure Groups step. \n\nFirst, select a user type you would like to manage groups for. You can manage groups for students, teachers, and or staff. Next,\nselect all of the groups you would like Clever IDM to manage.\n\nNote: you should only select groups that you want Clever IDM to add users to and remove them from. If a user is in a group but\nnone of Clever IDM’s membership rules indicate they should be in that group, Clever IDM will remove the user from the group.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve selected all the groups you’d like Clever IDM to manage for your selected user type, you can set up membership rules\nfor those groups. Click Add membership rule and create a rule for your groups. In this example, the rule will place users in\ngroups based on their graduation years.\n \n\nPlease note: Navigate to the Clever IDM: Formulas Help Center article to learn more about common formulas and operations that you\ncan use to manipulate data in Clever to create formulas!\n\n\n \n\nYou can add as many rules as you would like for each user type. Once you have created rules, you can always go back and edit or\ndelete them.\n\n\n\n\nClick Review Summary and run a sync preview to see any changes Clever IDM would make to users’ group memberships.\n\n \n\nActive Directory: Nested Groups\n\nActive Directory allows for group nesting. This is the process of making one Active Directory group a member of another group. A\nnested group inherits all the permissions and privileges of each group it is a member of.\n\nIn the example below, the group is SamTest, the sub-group is Groups, and the nested groups are 3-Group 4-Group,\nPreKindergarten-Group, etc.\n\n \n\nIn order for Clever IDM to manage nested groups, special group membership rule formatting is required.  For the nested groups to\nbe managed, the whole file path has to be in brackets (see below) otherwise the rule will cause an error.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nCan membership rules place users in distribution/email groups and security groups?\nYes! Clever IDM does not distinguish between security and distribution/email groups, so will add/remove users from any groups per\nthe district’s membership rules.\n\nWhat happens when a user leaves my district?\nWhen a user leaves a district, Clever IDM will archive that user. If group membership management is enabled, Clever IDM will\nremove the user from all groups, including default AD groups. If the user returns, Clever IDM will unarchive them and place them\nback in the appropriate groups per the district’s membership rules.\n\nWill users’ group membership update automatically?\nYes! Whenever Clever IDM syncs, it will re-evaluate all the membership rules for each user type and adjust users’ group\nmemberships accordingly. For example, if a user moves schools and a district’s membership rules are school-based, Clever IDM will\nremove that user from their old school and add them to the new school group.\n\nWill Clever IDM create a new group if one doesn’t exist?\nNo, Clever IDM will never create, edit, or delete existing groups. If Clever IDM evaluates a membership rule and the resulting\ngroup doesn’t exist, it will create an issue in the sync report. Once the relevant group is created in AD, the relevant users will\nbe added to it, and the issue will be resolved.\n\nWhy are some users not being added to groups?\nClever IDM won't manage group membership for groups outside of your chosen OU. You may manually add users to groups outside of\nyour OU, and Clever IDM will not remove a user from that group except when the users are archived.\n\nWhat will happen if a user has both a teacher and a staff account in Clever?\nClever IDM will manage their groups based on the primary role selected during Clever IDM setup.\n\nCan I review any potential changes before enabling group management?\nYes, after you set up your rules, Clever IDM will generate a preview. You'll review any changes to be made, and if satisfied,\nclick Provision!"

Email Notifications\n5. Email not updating in Clever\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article runs through how the Clever IDM sync works and how to identify and resolve issues with your sync.\n\nBy default, IDM syncs occur once per day, in the evening hours. At that time, Clever will compare the data in Clever to the\naccounts in Google, Active Directory, and/or Entra ID and create, update, or archive users appropriately. \n\n * Users added to Clever will have accounts created in Google, Active Directory, and/or Entra ID\n * Users deleted from Clever will have their accounts moved to the Archive OU in Google/Active Directory. In Entra ID, the account\n   will be disabled.\n * Users updated in Clever will be updated in Google, Active Directory and/or Entra ID if their user or organizational (e.g.,\n   school or grade level) attributes are changed.\n\nIf you would like to customize your district’s IDM sync time or frequency, contact Clever support.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTASKS\n\nThe Tasks tab contains a list of issues that need to be resolved for users.

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Pushing a sync\n3. Examples of when to pause\n4. Pausing a Clever IDM sync\n5. Resuming a Clever IDM sync\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM’s default behavior is to sync once daily, at night. At that time, Clever will compare the data in Clever to the\naccounts in Google/AD/Entra and create, update, or archive users appropriately. \n\nThere may be some reason that you want to temporarily pause your nightly Clever IDM sync, though. This article will walk you\nthrough the process of pushing, pausing, and resuming your Clever IDM syncs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPUSHING A SYNC\n\nTo initiate a manual sync of IDM:\n\n 1. In the dashboard menu, select IDM \n 2. Click on the desired destination\n 3. Click Edit <destination> provisioning\n    \n     \n    \n    \n 4. In the bottom right, click Provision <destination>\n    \n    \n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEXAMPLES OF WHEN TO PAUSE\n\nSome examples of when pausing your Clever IDM sync may be helpful: \n\n * Encountering issues with IDM? Pause your sync while you understand what the issue is. Resume your sync once you have identified\n   the issue.\n * Making big changes to your Clever sync (summer rollover, semester rollover, changing an SIS)? Pause your sync. When the\n   majority of your changes are complete, resume the sync. This will ensure that you don’t have too many rapid, unnecessary\n   changes in your provisioned Google/Active Directory/Entra accounts while the SIS changes are happening. \n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPAUSING CLEVER IDM SYNCS\n\nOn the Clever IDM dashboard, select the destination that you want to pause the syncs for. \n\n\n\nClick the Pause <Destination> Syncs button and confirm the pause in the pop-up.\n\nOnce you have confirmed the pause, your destination’s Clever IDM syncs should be paused. \n\nOn the Clever IDM dashboard, the destination will now have a Paused indicator, and a banner will appear, informing you that the\nsyncs are paused.\n\n\n\nWhile Clever IDM syncs are paused, you'll still be able to change your configuration settings and preview these changes. \n\nYou won't be able to provision the changes until you resume the IDM syncs. \n\nIf you have Clever IDM for more than one destination (e.g., for Google AND Active Directory), you can pause them each\nindividually. This means that your Google IDM sync can still continue while your Active Directory IDM sync is paused. \n\nHowever, this also means you must manually pause both of them if you do not want any IDM syncs to run. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRESUMING CLEVER IDM SYNCS\n\nTo resume Clever IDM syncs, click the Resume <destination> Syncs button on the IDM dashboard. \n\n\n\nA popup will appear, asking you to confirm the change. When you press confirm, Clever IDM will automatically kick off a preview of\nyour accounts for you. Please review these changes and verify they are correct before your next nightly IDM sync. If you notice\nany unexpected changes, you may pause your syncs again at any time as you resolve the issues.\n\nAnother way to resume Clever IDM syncs is to click the Resume Syncs button in the banner that informs you that your IDM syncs are\npaused. It works exactly the same as the button on the IDM dashboard.\n\nRelated articles\n\n * Clever IDM: Overview\n * Clever IDM: Summer Rollover\n * Clever IDM: Sync Reports"

We have updated the name change throughout this article.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM allows sync data export via download and SFTP from The IDM Dashboard > Exports tab.\n\nUsing this feature, Clever IDM customers can write Clever IDM-generated data back to PowerSchool. This provides another option for\nschools and can save Clever admin time.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAVAILABLE FIELDS\n\nCurrently, the fields available from Clever to write back are Google email or AD/Entra ID userPrincipalName and passwords for any\ndestination. Clever IDM export files include rows for all IDM-managed accounts by user type.\n\nWriteback leverages PowerSchool’s AutoComm tool and AutoComm-compatible reports generated by Clever IDM. AutoComm is set up to\nautomatically ingest data from an SFTP server. Find out more about the AutoComm setup here.\n\nPlease note that AutoComm cannot write to the PowerSchool email field. If you want to store the email from Clever, you’ll need to\nset up a PowerSchool extension field to do so.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP POWERSCHOOL WRITEBACK\n\nFollow these steps for setting up PowerSchool writeback:\n\nSteps 1-2 should be completed in Clever.\n\n 1. If exporting passwords, you must be using Clever IDM and have Allow password export enabled for each user type. This is\n    configured in the Set login credentials step in the IDM wizard.\n     \n\n\n\n 2. Enable SFTP access for IDM exports under the Exports tab in IDM Enable writeback via the Autocomm feature in PowerSchool.\n\n\n\n \n\nSteps 3-12 should be completed in PowerSchool.\n\n 3.  Navigate to System > System Settings > Plugin Management > Remote Connection Manager and select Enable Managed Connection.\n 4.  Navigate to Remote Connection Manager > Create Connection and add Clever IDM SFTP credentials (copied from Clever Dashboard).\n     \n      \n     \n     \n 5.  Enable writeback via the Autocomm feature in PowerSchool.\n 6.  Select your user type (students or teachers) under Table to Writeback.\n 7.  Get Input from:\n     1.

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Default behavior\n3. Pausing Clever IDM syncs\n4. Options for syncing during the summer\n5. Back to school\n6. Preserving access\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM is built to work seamlessly with your existing summer rollover practices – from preparing for summer school, to getting\nready for back to school, to preserving access for graduated students. This article is your guide for what to expect and the tools\nand processes you can use to customize Clever IDM – and Clever, more broadly – to fit your needs.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDEFAULT BEHAVIOR\n\nClever syncs are set to pause at the end of the school year and unpause just before the back to school season. When your sync is\npaused, data in Clever won’t be automatically modified or changed.\n\nBy default, Clever IDM’s nightly syncs will continue to run. Since there are no automatic data updates happening in Clever, most\nof the time Clever IDM syncs won’t have any impact. There are two exceptions:\n\n 1. Custom data. If your district modifies custom data in Clever during your sync pause, Clever IDM will sync newly created or\n    modified users to your identity provider.\n 2. Manual changes in a destination. If someone in your district manually updates users in Google or Active Directory, Clever IDM\n    may revert those changes on its next sync – if they conflict with Clever data. For example, if you move a Clever-managed user\n    to a new OU in Google, Clever IDM will move that user back to its original OU during the next sync. Note: this is only true\n    for users that Clever IDM actively manages. Clever IDM will not make any changes to users that it doesn’t manage.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPAUSING CLEVER IDM SYNCS\n\nIf you would like Clever IDM’s nightly syncs to pause during this time, please use the “Pause <destination> Syncs” button, found\non the IDM dashboard. \n\nIf you have multiple IDM destinations (e.g. Google AND Active Directory), you must pause both of them, as pausing only applies to\nthe currently selected destination. You can resume Clever IDM syncs at any time.\n\nLearn more about pausing IDM syncs here.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nOPTIONS FOR SYNCING DURING THE SUMMER\n\nSome districts may want Clever IDM to automatically create and manage accounts for users over the summer. The easiest way to\nmanage this is through the use of custom data. Our Summer School: Overview article includes a comprehensive guide for how to\nmanage summer school data in Clever. Any users added via custom data will be automatically synced through Clever IDM’s nightly\nsyncs.\n\nIf custom data isn’t a good option for your district, you can consider delaying your sync pause so that summer school data is\nupdated in Clever before your pause starts.\n\nIn some cases, it may make sense to not pause your Clever sync at all. For example, if you’d like to continue syncing staff and\nteachers to Clever – so they have their accounts created – but don’t want to use custom data. Districts using an SFTP sync can\nachieve this by continuing to sync the teachers.csv and staff.csv but temporarily pausing the syncing of all other files. We\nrecommend discussing this option with the Clever team so you understand the implications.\n\nLastly, as need be, you can manually provision users in Google or Active Directory while your sync is paused. When your sync\nresumes, Clever IDM will match the newly created users and begin to manage them.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL\n\nOnce your sync is unpaused for the coming school year, new data will begin flowing into Clever and old data will be removed. Once\nthe data for the upcoming year is successfully synced, Clever IDM will update data in Google and/or Active Directory accordingly.\n\nHere are the most common changes you can expect from Clever IDM:\n\n * Creating new users who’ve joined your district for the new school year. This includes the newest class of students, any\n   students who’ve transferred from other districts, as well as any teachers or staff that have joined.\n * Updating existing users. The most common updates are OU changes. If your district’s OU structure involves schools or grade\n   levels, you should expect Clever IDM to move students to their new OUs and sub-OUs.\n * Archiving removed users. Any users that have been removed from your Clever sync during your pause will be archived by Clever\n   IDM. That includes graduated or promoted students as well as any students, teachers, and staff who have left the district for\n   other reasons.\n\nIf you’re using the graduation year field in Clever IDM and aren’t syncing graduation year values directly to Clever from your\nSIS, you’ll also see the following prompt in Clever IDM when you unpause:\n\n \n\nClever IDM calculates the graduation year based on the student’s synced grade level if you are not already sending graduation year\ndata via your SIS. This prompt is to ensure that this calculation associates your data with the correct school year. Data synced\nbefore the graduation rollover date will be associated with the previous school year for graduation year calculations. Data synced\nafter the graduation rollover date will be associated with the upcoming school year for graduation year calculations. Providing a\ngraduation rollover date enables Clever IDM to automatically update any information based on the graduation year (OUs, groups,\netc.) as grade levels change during rollover. If your expected graduation rollover date changes, you can edit the graduation\nrollover date anytime by navigating to the Select Users step in Clever IDM. Once you confirm that the graduation rollover date is\ncorrect, Clever IDM will continue syncing with the correct graduation years.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPRESERVING ACCESS \n\nBy default, Clever IDM will archive graduated students as soon as they’re removed from Clever. In most cases, graduated students\nremain in Clever until a district’s sync is unpaused. That means, they’ll retain access to Google and/or Active Directory during\nthat period. Once the sync resumes, these users will then lose access.\n\nIf you’d like graduated users to retain access beyond your unpause date, you can:\n\n 1. Set Clever IDM to not suspend or deactivate users in ignored OUs in the OUs setup step (see below), and\n 2. Move those graduated students to an ignored OU. Once in an ignored OUs, these users will retain access until you move them out\n    of an ignored OU or manually deactivate them.\n\n\nIf you’d like graduated users not to retain access beyond your unpause date, you can either have them removed from your Clever\nsync before you pause or move the users to an ignored OU in Google or Active Directory and manually deactivate them there.\n \n \n \nIf you have any questions about summer rollover with Clever IDM that haven’t been answered here, please reach out to\nSupport.Clever.com.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated articles: \nClever IDM: Overview\nClever IDM: Active Directory Setup\nClever IDM: Purchasing & Billing\nClever IDM: Sync Reports\nClever IDM: Pausing Syncs"

Preview & Provision\n    \n    * Preview your Clever IDM setup including updates, new users created, etc.\n    \n    * With approval from your team and a Clever IDM onboarding specialist, begin provisioning.\n    \n    * Review the provisioning process to ensure no errors or unexpected changes occur.\n\n 6. Password reset and account recovery (optional)\n    \n    * As part of Clever IDM, you can configure password reset and account recovery options for any destination and user type you\n      choose to provision for (students, teachers, staff). This enables you to configure settings such as forcing users to reset\n      passwords on first login, allowing teachers to reset student passwords, and setting up account recovery options should a\n      password be forgotten.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTIMELINE\n\nThe timelines shared below are general guidance for approximately how long most districts take to complete their Clever IDM setup\nprocess and a recommended timeline from our teams.  This timeline may vary depending on your district or school’s unique needs and\nsetup.\n\n \n\nThis is an example timeline for setting up Clever IDM. Implementation timelines will vary based on your district goals and\ntimeline.\n\nWeek 1\n\n * Work with a district partnerships specialist to learn more general information about Clever IDM, receive a quote for your\n   district, verify your Clever IDM order, and activate your services.\n\n * Once your service is activated, you’ll begin working with a Clever IDM onboarding engineer to discuss your goals, dig into the\n   specifics of your configuration based on your current environment, and develop a custom implementation plan.\n\nWeek 2\n\n * Complete your Clever IDM setup steps with support from your onboarding engineer as needed. These steps typically include:\n   \n   * Connecting to your first destination (Google, Active Directory, or Entra ID)\n   \n   * Selecting your users\n   \n   * Setting login credentials\n   \n   * Organizing OU structure (Google and Active Directory only)\n   \n   * Creating group membership rules (Google and Active Directory only)\n   \n   * Additional field mappings\n\n * If you wish to set up multiple destinations, they will be configured later in the setup process. The Clever team recommends\n   setting up one destination at a time.\n\nWeek 3\n\n * Review summary and preview changes with our onboarding engineer team. You’ll look for any last-minute changes or errors.\n\n * Go live with provisioning and continue to monitor the sync.\n\nWeek 4\n\n * Further troubleshooting if needed.\n\n * Setting up any additional destinations (add a week of setup time for each additional destination).\n\n * Continued support from the Clever Support team beyond your onboarding implementation.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)\n\nHow long does it take to set up Clever IDM?\n\n * Most districts take approximately four weeks to set up their first Clever IDM destination. Additional destinations typically\n   take less time to configure since you’re more familiar with the setup process.\n\nDoes the setup timeline change if I’m provisioning multiple destinations?\n\n * Yes. Plan to spend an additional week of setup for each destination.\n\nCan this timeline be expedited?\n\n * This timeline varies greatly depending on each district or school’s current environment. The timeline also depends on your\n   availability to make data changes or updates as needed during the setup process (like inputting user emails to your student\n   information system (SIS) to ensure proper data syncing with Clever IDM).\n\nWhat is the difference between your district partnerships team and your onboarding engineers?\n\n * Our District Partnerships team helps educate you on Clever IDM, assists in verifying your order, and gets everything set up and\n   activated. Our onboarding engineers ensure the technical implementation runs smoothly and meets your district’s unique\n   requirements.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles: \n\n * Clever IDM: Google setup\n\n * Clever IDM: Active Directory setup\n\n * Clever IDM: Entra ID setup\n\n * Clever IDM: Overview\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Resetting teacher passwords\n         •For Log in with Clever\n         •For third-Party accounts (Active Directory, Entra ID, or Google)\n3. Resetting student passwords\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNot being able to log in is no fun. However, if your school district is using Clever Passwords, Active Directory, Entra ID, or\nGoogle Workspace as a login method, you may be able to reset your password and the passwords of your students (students may also\nhave the ability to reset their passwords). This depends on whether your school district has enabled this feature. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRESETTING TEACHER PASSWORDS\n\nNot all school districts allow teachers to reset their passwords. If you don’t see the option to reset your password, or if these\nsteps don't resolve the issue, please get in touch with your school district's tech support contact directly for help.\n\n\nFOR LOG IN WITH CLEVER\n\n \n\nIf you’re not able to access Clever using your Log in with Clever credentials, follow these steps:\n\n 1. Select Get help logging in! to reset your password using the email address linked to your district's Clever account. \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 2. Choose Reset your password\n    \n     \n    \n    \n    \n 3. Enter the email that you signed up with to receive password reset instructions, and click Send.  \n    \n     \n\n \n\nUpdating your Log in with Clever password from within your Enhanced Teacher Portal\n\nAlternatively, if you do have access to your Teacher Portal and want to update your Log in with Clever password for any reason\n(e.g., you feel your passwords may have been compromised), you can do so by following these steps from your Teacher Portal:\n\n 1. Click on your blue icon in the upper right corner to bring up your settings.\n    \n     \n\n 2. From underneath Log in password click Change password to update. \n\n \n\n\nFOR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS (ACTIVE DIRECTORY, ENTRA ID, OR GOOGLE)\n\nIf your school has enabled it, you can use a backup method (such as email, security questions, or phone number) to regain access\nto your Active Directory, Entra ID, and Google Workspace accounts right from your Clever login screen. This is handy if you cannot\nlog in with your password successfully. \n\nSetting up your backup method\n\nAdding a password recovery method will give you a password reset option if you ever get locked out of both your Clever account and\nyour district's Google, Active Directory, or Entra ID account. Consider it your login insurance policy!\n\nTo set up your backup method (again, if your school had enabled this functionality), you need to navigate to your Enhanced Teacher\nPortal. \n\nClever tip callout box: To see how students need to reset their accounts, check out this article: For Students: Troubleshooting -\nLogging in to Clever.\n\n 1. Click on your blue icon in the upper right corner to bring up your settings. \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 2. Click on Set up recovery methods. The recovery methods available to you depend on what your school district has enabled.\n 3. Choose a recovery method and input the information.\n 4. Depending on what you choose for a recovery method, you will be prompted on how to continue.\n\nNow that you've set up your recovery method, you can utilize the Third-party account recovery if you ever find yourself locked out\nof your Clever and Google/Active Directory/Entra ID account:\n\n 1. From the Clever login screen, click on get help logging in.\n 2. Choose Recover Third-Party accounts with backup method. \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 3. Input your school district email address (not to be confused with a recovery email you have set up). \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 4. You’ll be prompted to confirm your identity using a method you set up in your Portal settings.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n 5. You can now set up your new password for the third-party account by inputting a new password. Your school may have password\n    requirements, which can be viewed by clicking on See requirements. Once completed, you can use your new password for your\n    third-party account(s).\n    \n     \n\nUpdating your third-party password from within your Teacher Portal\n\nAlternatively, if you have access to your Teacher Portal and want to update your third-party passwords for any reason (e.g., you\nfeel your passwords may have been compromised), you can do so by clicking on Change third-party password within the Portal. \n\nThis is independent of the account recovery process and doesn’t require you to go through the recovery method.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRESETTING STUDENT PASSWORDS\n\nIf your school has enabled it, you can reset student passwords for Log in with Clever and Third-Party accounts such as Active\nDirectory, Entra ID, or Google. Best of all, it can be done right from your Enhanced Teacher Portal! \n\nTo update a student’s password:\n\n 1. Click on My Students in the menu on the left side of your Teacher Portal.\n 2. Choose Student Roster.\n 3. You can find the student by filtering by class and then clicking on the student from the roster. \n    \n     \n    In the screenshot above, the wording in the highlighted area may be slightly different depending on which login methods your\n    school uses. In this example, the school is using Clever Passwords and third-party passwords.\n    \n    \n 4. You’ll see Student Tools on the right side of the Portal under the student’s name. From there, you can click on the password\n    option you need to update. \n\nOnce updated, your student should be able to log in successfully with the new password you've created. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Linking accounts between Clever and a destination\n3. Common troubleshooting\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever IDM account links are the glue that ties a Clever IDM account and a destination, such as Google, Active Directory, or Entra\nID, together. When an IDM sync runs, we create a link between what's in Clever and what's in the destination and provision a\ndestination account and email based on the Clever account.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLINKING ACCOUNTS BETWEEN CLEVER AND A DESTINATION\n\nWhen an IDM sync runs, Clever creates a link between a Clever account and an account in either Google, AD, or Entra ID. If Clever\nIDM can't find an existing account with the relevant username or email address for a user, it will create a new account in the\ndestination and link it to the corresponding account in Clever.\nLinks are useful in preventing issues. An example would be when a student graduates that happens to have the same username as an\nincoming freshman.\n\n 1. User 1, jsmith graduates.\n 2. User 2, jsmith is an incoming freshman.\n 3. We don’t want user 2 taking over all of user 1’s Google account!\n 4. Clever throws a conflict to flag for the Clever admin. \n\nWithout the links, we would erroneously automatch Clever user 2 with the old jsmith account.\n\nOccasionally, because of inaccurate data in Clever or a destination, Clever IDM will incorrectly link a Clever account to an\naccount in a destination. \n\nFor instance, if a user's email is synced to Clever with a typo in it, or it’s the incorrect email. In such cases, the link\nconnects that Clever user to the incorrect email address.\n\nWhen this happens, you can remove the link, fix the typo,  and run a new Clever IDM sync. You can remove the link by going to the\nClever Dashboard > User’s profile page > Details tab > Clever IDM Information box > click Unlink user.\n\n \n\n \n As long as you correct the data in Clever and/or the destination, the new link will be correct.\n\n\nThe link creation lifecycle follows these steps:\n\n 1. Clever IDM creates a link when we find a matching account in a destination or when it provisions a new account in the\n    destination.\n    \n    * Example: Joyce is a new student at the school district, and her email address in Clever is provisioned in the destination\n      and linked to her Clever account.\n 2. If your school district syncs the user's email and username from your SIS, the link is updated automatically if the username\n    changes. If you rely on a template-generated username or email, you must unlink to create a new template-generated username or\n    email.\n    * Example: Joyce is officially adopted by her family, and she now has a new last name. This, in turn, changed her username and\n      email. Her link is automatically updated since you’re syncing her username and email from the SIS!\n 3. If the Clever user is no longer in your SIS, we archive them via IDM.\n    \n    If a user returns to Clever within one year of departure and is in an Archive OU, their Clever account will be restored, and\n    their account moved from the Archive OU to the appropriate active OU based on your Parent/Sub-OU settings. \n    \n    If a user returns after one year, a new Clever and destination account will be generated.\n    * Example: Joyce has the opportunity to be an exchange student for 6 months, so she leaves her school district temporarily.\n      When she gets back, her account is restored.\n 4. Once they’re archived in IDM, the destination account as disabled.\n 5. If desired, you’ll need to delete the accounts manually\n    * Example: A couple of years later, Joyce graduates. Many Clever admins keep graduated seniors in archive OUs for a few months\n      after graduation before deleting them\n 6. Once the Clever user and the destination user are entirely deleted, we delete the link upon the next IDM sync.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCOMMON TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nHere are a few examples of some common issues: \n\nIssue\n\nResolution\n\nA user gets married, changes their name, and has a new email address. The link for that user is connected to the old email.If your\nschool district syncs the user's email and username from your SIS, the link is updated automatically if the username or email\nchanges.\n\nIf you rely on a template-generated username or email, you must unlink to create a new template-generated username or email. \n\nOnce updated, the account will be correctly linked after the next Clever IDM sync.\n\nOops! There’s a typo in a user’s email that has been synced to Clever. Now that user is linked to the wrong email address.If your\nschool district syncs the user's email and username from your SIS, the link is updated automatically if the username or email\nchanges.\n\nIf you rely on a template-generated username or email, you must unlink to create a new template-generated username or email. \n\nOnce updated, the account will be correctly \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED ARTICLES: \n\n * Clever IDM: Sync reports & issue troubleshooting\n * Clever IDM: Google Setup\n * Clever IDM: Active Directory Setup\n * Clever IDM: Entra ID Setup\n    \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. What is Classroom MFA?\n3. Pricing\n4. Getting Started\n5. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClassroom Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  is a second layer of security for Clever without a second device. Classroom MFA\nprotects applications that use Clever for single sign-on with age-appropriate second factors like Clever Badges or login pictures.\nThis includes the Clever Portal, Google Workspace, and Google Chromebooks. This solution helps districts stay ahead of\ncybersecurity threats without disrupting learning.\n\n \n\nBy providing a dual layer of authentication, Classroom MFA can help you meet cybersecurity insurance requirements and worry less\nabout compromised credentials for your students, teachers, and instructional staff.\n\n \n\nClassroom MFA works by requiring a second factor of authentication for students and teachers via Clever Badges, pictures,\nauthenticator apps, SMS, voice calls, or biometrics/hardware tokens, for any Clever-based SSO login. With the ability to require\nre-authentication for login attempts outside your designated country or network, rest assured potential bad actors will hit your\nMFA wall and get turned away.\n\n   \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS CLASSROOM MFA?\n\nThis is a way for your students and teachers to securely MFA into Clever to protect all of your Clever applications without the\nrequirement of a second device. Classroom MFA protects the Clever portal for your users. Any application that a student or teacher\naccesses from the Clever portal will have a layer of protection.\n\n \n\nClassroom MFA currently supports the following factors:\n\n * Picture logins\n * Clever Badges\n * PIN (6-digits)\n * Authenticator apps\n * Text message (SMS)\n * Voice call\n * Biometrics or security key (if this has been configured on the user's device) \n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPRICING\n\nThe pricing for Classroom MFA is $1.50 per user per year, plus an initial implementation fee.\n\nDistricts can preview Classroom MFA before purchasing here in your Clever Dashboard!  After completing the configuration and\nviewing a free preview, IT administrators can purchase Classroom MFA directly in the Clever App Store.\n\nClever’s digital learning platform (including single sign-on, rostering, messaging, and analytics) remains completely free for\ndistricts.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nYou can learn how to get started with Classroom MFA by checking out our article For Clever Admins: Classroom MFA Setup or\nconnecting with one of our cybersecurity specialists here: https://www.getclever.com/mfa-contact-a-specialist\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nHow is Classroom MFA different from other MFA options on the market available? \n\n * Most MFA solutions available on the market are not designed for the classroom and require a second device to be present with\n   their user. Classroom MFA eliminates the need for a second device making it accessible to teachers and students. \n\n \n\nWill Classroom MFA work for my staff users? \n\n * Yes, your staff will be protected for any applications that are accessed only via single sign-on through Clever. If you would\n   like to learn more or have other requirements for staff users, please connect with a cybersecurity specialist here:\n   https://www.getclever.com/mfa-contact-a-specialist\n\n \n\nCan students use the same Clever Badge they already use to log into Clever as their MFA Badge method login? \n\n * No, a Clever Badge and MFA Badge are not the same thing. For maximum security, we strongly recommend that districts assign an\n   alternative MFA factor for students who already Badge into Clever.  \n\n \n\nWhich applications are covered by Classroom MFA? \n\n * Classroom MFA will cover all Single Sign-on (SSO) and Rostering & Single Sign-on (SSO) applications. This includes the Clever\n   Portal, Google Workspace, and Google Chromebooks.\n\n \n\nHow can Classroom MFA protect Google? \n\n * Classroom MFA can protect Google through the Workspace application. Learn how to set up the Workspace app to protect Google for\n   your district here!\n\nCan students use Classroom MFA when logging into a Chromebook with a Clever Badge?\n\n * Yes!

User self-enrollment\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article walks through the setup process for Classroom MFA.\n\nFor more information on how Classroom MFA works, pricing, and FAQs, please refer to this Help Center article. If you are\ninterested protecting Google through the Workspace application, please refer to this Setup Guide. \n\n\nFor more robust information, including teacher training resources and email templates to roll out Classroom MFA, we recommend\ngoing through our Clever Academy Classroom MFA Quick Start Guide.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nYou can begin setting up Classroom MFA right in your Clever Dashboard. Click here to jump right in and start your first MFA policy\nsetup. \n\n \n\nIn this guide, we'll mention end-users. End-users are people who will use MFA while accessing Clever, like students, teachers, or\ninstructional staff.\n\n \n\n\nSTEP 1: SELECT USERS WHO WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE MFA:\n\n * By Group\n   * Students\n     * All students\n     * Students by schools, grades, and/or groups (IEP or ELL status)\n   * Teachers\n     * All Teachers\n     * Teachers by schools\n   * All Staff\n * Or by specific users\n\n \n\nClassroom MFA can be set up with unique policies that you can combine subsets of users in. For your first policy, you may want to\nstart with a small subset of test users rather than all teachers or staff. However, the decision is up to you. Learn about the\ndifferences between Staff and Teacher users here. District administrators also have some MFA options natively built into Clever,\nwhich you can read about here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: SELECT MFA METHODS\n\nYou can choose multiple MFA methods for your end users to choose from. When an end user (e.g. teacher) sets up their MFA, they'll\nget a list of possible MFA methods to set up. In this step, you'll define what MFA methods will be displayed as possible methods\nto an end user.\n\nIt’s a good practice to have at least one other authentication method available to users so they can have a backup method. This\nway, if they are not able to use one method for any reason (e.g. their cell phone is not charged) they can use a backup method to\nsuccessfully log in. This saves time by providing an alternative to users.\n\n * Picture Logins\n   * End-user uses two pictures that they select to verify their identity.\n   * This method is only permitted for students.\n   * Recommended for K-6 students, as it is easy to use.\n   * This option does not require a second device.  \n * Badges\n   * End-user scans a printed or downloaded QR code via a device camera as a second factor after they provide their password.\n   * Recommended for students in grades 7-12. It pairs well with a password as the first authentication method. Recommended for\n     teachers as a non-phone alternative.\n   * This option doesn't require a second device.  \n   * Teachers can manage MFA Badges for their students right from their Teacher Portal. Find out more here. \n\nPlease note: If your students already use a Clever Badge to SSO into Clever, we advise against using the MFA Badge as well because\nit will result in needing two badges to log into Clever. This is less secure than a Badge + other authentication method.  \n\n * PIN\n   * End user sets their own PIN by entering a 6-digit PIN code that they select to verify their identity. For security reasons,\n     students cannot use sequential numbers (e.g., 123456, 678901) or repetitive digits (e.g. 000000, 111111). Attempting to use\n     sequential or repetitive digits will surface an error during setup that states, “PIN is too weak.”\n   * This method is only permitted for students.\n   * Recommended for students in grades 4-8.\n   * This option doesn’t require a second device.\n   * Teachers can help manage MFA PINs for their students right from their Teacher Portal. Learn more here.\n * Mobile app\n   * End-user uses an app that generates a verification code - a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). They'll use this code to\n     verify their identity during MFA.\n   * Choose an app that you recommend your end user should use to generate verification codes:\n     * Google Authenticator or\n     * Microsoft Microsoft Authenticator\n   * Authenticator apps are not dependent on wifi or internet networks to generate codes so these are great options for those with\n     network concerns.\n   * We recommend using this method as it has a good combination of security strength and convenience. \n * App-based token\n   * End-user uses an app that generates a verification code - a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). They'll use this code to\n     verify their identity during MFA.\n   * Choose an app that you recommend your end-user should use to generate verification codes:\n     * Google Authenticator or\n     * Microsoft Authenticator\n   * We recommend using this method as it has a good combination of security strength and convenience.\n * Biometrics or security key (e.g., Apple Touch ID, Windows Hello, Yubikey) \n   * End user uses a physical hardware key that plugs into the user device or is included in the device for authentication.\n   * Please note that Clever does not provide or re-sell hardware tokens. These must be district-provided. \n * Text message \n   * End user provides a phone number and receives a verification code by text message (SMS). Text message does not support\n     International numbers.\n * Voice Call\n   * End user provides a phone number and receives a verification code through an automatic voice message (call). Voice phone\n     numbers support extensions. Voice phone numbers do not support international numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: CONFIGURE MFA SETTINGS\n\n * Enforcement date (required)\n   * End users will be prompted while logging into Clever to set up MFA two weeks before the enforcement date. They can skip the\n     MFA setup until the enforcement date. After that, an end user will be required to set up MFA before being able to access\n     Clever.\n   * When you select Skip enforcement date, it will make MFA optional for end users. They can set up MFA within their own profile\n     settings but won’t be required to add it. \n   * If you’re testing Classroom MFA, you’ll want to set the enforcement date within two weeks of when you want your test policy\n     users to get set up, so it automatically triggers their enrollment. \n * Re-authentication frequency (required)\n   * Select how often a user will be prompted to MFA while logging into Clever:\n     * Every time - end user has to use MFA every time they log in to Clever.\n     * Every 7 days - end user will use MFA every 7 days to log in to Clever.\n     * Every 30 days - end user will use MFA every 30 days to log in to Clever.\n   * Optionally, you can add more conditions to the “Every 7-day” and “Every 30 days” settings by clicking Advanced settings. \n\n\n * In Advanced settings, you'll define safe zones, where the end user will use MFA every X days to log in. End users outside\n   defined safe zones must re-authenticate every time. To define a safe zone use:\n   * Trusted user locations. Select country(s) where end users can log in every X days. \n   * User new location. When an end user logs in from a new location, they must log in with MFA.\n   * Trusted networks. Specify networks with CIDR blocks where end users can log in every X days.\n\n\n\nPlease note: If you configure multiple MFA policies, after setup you will be able to rearrange policies to sort by order of\npreferred precedence. \n \n\n\n \n\n * Guardian support\n   * You can allow guardians to receive a one-time MFA bypass code via email to bypass the student’s MFA if a student forgets\n     their second factor. We only recommend enabling this feature if your district syncs accurate guardian contact emails to\n     Clever. You can review the guardian information syncing to Clever via the Clever Dashboard > Data Browser > Contacts tab.\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: SET POLICY NAME\n\nOn this page you will name your policy. We recommend choosing a distinctive name and adding a description to describe the policy\nthat you just set up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 5: PREVIEW AND COMPLETE MFA CONFIGURATION\n\nOn this page is a summary of all the selections you have made in previous steps. We recommend checking if everything is correct.\nIf yes, complete your MFA configuration. You can always come back and edit your MFA configuration.\n\n \n\nThat’s it! You’ve configured Classroom MFA. Congratulations on securing authentication for classrooms with Clever!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEXPLORING THE MFA DASHBOARD\n\nAfter completing setup, we recommend you check out the MFA dashboard, where you can:\n\n * Get an overview of MFA status, the number of end-users who were assigned to use MFA, and the number of end-users who activated\n   and didn’t activate MFA.\n\n * Access detailed MFA end-user list and MFA configuration\n\n * Add a new MFA Policy and reorder existing policies based on preferred precedence\n\n * Edit your MFA configuration\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSER SELF-ENROLLMENT\n\nOnce the district is within two weeks of the enforcement date of Classroom MFA that you determined during admin setup, the users\nyou have assigned to MFA will begin to see a setup box upon login (See an example here: https://clever.com/oauth/mfa/settings).\nThey can follow the prompts to choose the best methods for them and after completion should immediately receive their first\nauthentication prompt. End users will be able to set up multiple MFA methods if they wish. \n\n \n\nUsers can choose to set up later if they wish, up until the enforcement date.\n\n \n\n\nHERE'S A RUN-THROUGH OF THE STEPS END USERS WILL GO THROUGH:\n\nStep 1:\n\n\n\n \n\nStep 2: (this will vary depending on the user type)\n\n\n\n \n\nStep 3:  (this will vary depending on the authentication method chosen)\n\n\n\n \n\nStep 4:\n\n\n\n \n\nUsers can change their settings if desired, such as to set up another authentication method. Users can navigate to their account\nicon (top right corner) > MFA settings\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTo ensure the admin has visibility into the activation status of your users, you can reference the user report on the Classroom\nMFA dashboard. \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  Related Articles: \n\n * For Clever Admins: Classroom MFA Overview\n * For Teachers & Staff: Setting up Classroom MFA\n * For Students: Setting up Classroom MFA"

Adding authentication methods\n5. Using Classroom MFA after setup\n\nPlease note: If you’re an admin trying to set up Classroom MFA for your teachers and staff, please reference this article. \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article has information for teachers and staff on setting up Clever’s Classroom Multi-Factor Authentication (Classroom MFA).\nAs an optional add-on feature, Clever offers districts Classroom MFA for short to provide an extra layer of security for teacher\nand student logins.\n\nYou’ll only have access to Classroom MFA if your district has added it to your district Clever account. \n\nFor information on how to help your student’s set up their Classroom MFA, please see our article For Teachers: Helping your\nstudents set up and troubleshoot Classroom MFA.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT'S CLASSROOM MFA?\n\nMFA is a way to log in to programs that requires you to use two methods (or factors) to prove your identity, like your username\nand password on your computer and a text message code sent to your phone. You likely already use MFA when signing in to other\nprograms, such as your online bank account.\n\n \n\nClever’s Classroom Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) creates a second layer of security for student and teacher accounts without\nthe need for a second device. This will help you to protect sensitive information through secured access without disrupting\nlearning in your classroom.\n\n \n\nClassroom MFA works by requiring a second factor of authentication for students and teachers using one of the following options\nthat has been pre-selected by your district: \n\n * Picture logins (students only)\n * Clever Badges\n * PIN (students only)\n * Authenticator app\n * Text message (SMS)\n * Voice call\n * Biometrics or security key\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP CLASSROOM MFA\n\n 1. Go to your school or district's login screen (For example: Clever.com/in/district-URL) and sign in the way you normally do.\n    You'll be prompted to set up Clever Classroom MFA.\n\n\n\n 2. You’ll be presented with one or more authentication methods. Read more about authentication methods below. Choose a method and\n    click Next step. \n\n\n\n 4. Follow the instructions to set up the authentication method. You can learn more about authentication options below. \n\n 5. Once you’ve finished the instructions, click Exit settings.\n\n 6. Optional: If your district offers more than one authentication method, you can click Set up another method to add another\n    authentication option.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING AUTHENTICATION METHODS\n\nReminder: Authentication methods are used to prove your identity. You must add at least one authentication method to use Classroom\nMFA.\n\n \n\nIt is best practice to add multiple methods if your school has made other options available to you. This way, if you’re not able\nto use one method for any reason (e.g. your cell phone is not charged so you can’t get a text message ) you can use another method\nto successfully log in. This saves time by providing an alternative method for yourself.\n\n \n\n\nTEXT MESSAGE (ALSO CALLED SMS) \n\nA numeric code is texted to a cell phone number you chose; you can type this code into your Clever login screen.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * Make sure the number you add when setting up Classroom MFA will go to a phone you can access during the school day, as you’ll\n   need the code texted to this number to log in to Clever. \n * Also, keep in mind that this will not work for a landline. If you can only access a landline, consider an automated voice phone\n   call.\n\n \n\n\nAUTOMATED VOICE PHONE CALL \n\nA numeric code is shared via an automated voice phone call to a number you choose (can be a landline or cell phone); you then type\nthis code into your Clever login screen.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * This will trigger a phone call to the number you added, so ensure you’ll be able to answer the phone and hear the code shared.\n\n \n\n\nMOBILE APP \n\nYou install an app on a cell phone that provides you with a numeric code you type into your Clever login screen.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * To access this option, you’ll need to install an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator or Authy) to a mobile device\n   or tablet and follow the Classroom MFA setup steps in Clever. Be sure you can access this  device during the school day. You’ll\n   need to scan a QR code, so ensure the camera works on the device.\n * Authenticator applications work without requiring cell service or network so this is still a great option if you have cell\n   service concerns.\n\n \n\nSetup steps, Google Authenticator App:\nIf your district uses the Microsoft Authenticator App, please see the directions here.\n \n\n 1. On your cell phone, install the app by searching “Google Authenticator App” in the Google Play Store (Android) or the App\n    Store (Apple). The app icon looks like this:\n\n\n\nYou can also click the links below to access the download page for the apps, but be sure to download the app onto your phone or\nmobile device, not on your computer:\n\n      \n\n 2. On your computer, open the Classroom MFA setup steps (this will show up after you attempt to log in to Clever), or, if you’re\n    already logged in, go to the top right corner of your Clever screen and click the person icon (👤), then MFA settings.\n\n 3. In the Classroom MFA setup directions, choose the App authentication method and click Next step until you see the QR code (it\n    looks like a square bar code).\n\n 4. From your phone, open the authenticator app and select Scan a QR code. You may need to grant permission for the app to use\n    your device’s camera. \n\n 5. Scan the QR code on the computer screen using your device’s camera. \n\n 6. After scanning the code, click Next step on your computer.\n\n 7. On your device, the app will provide you with a code. On your computer, type this code into the provided space on the\n    Classroom MFA setup screen. \n\n 8. Click Done.\n\n 9. Click Exit settings. You’re all set.\n\nAfter this initial setup, when prompted to use Classroom MFA, you won’t need to scan a QR code: you’ll just open the Google\nAuthenticator App and tap on the account you added. You’ll be provided with a numeric code to type into Clever. The code will\nchange every 30 seconds. \n\n\n \n\nSetup steps, Microsoft Authenticator App:\nIf your district uses the Google Authenticator App, please see the directions here.\n\n 1. On your cell phone or mobile device, install the app by searching “Microsoft Authenticator App” in the Google Play Store\n    (Android) or the App Store (Apple). The app icon looks like this:\n\n\n\nYou can also click the links below to access the download page for the apps, but be sure to download the app onto your mobile\ndevice, not on your computer.\n\n     \n\n 2.  On your computer, open the Classroom MFA setup steps (this will show up after you attempt to log in to Clever), or, if you’re\n     already logged in, go to the top right corner of your Clever screen and click the person icon (👤), then MFA settings.\n\n 3.  In the Classroom MFA setup directions, choose the App authentication method and click Next step until you see the QR code.\n\n 4.  From your mobile device, open the authenticator app, and review any user/privacy terms. If prompted to log in, you can press\n     Skip in the top right corner (unless you have an account your district has given you directions to log into).\n\n 5.  Press the Add account button, then Work or school account, then select Scan a QR code. You may need to grant permission for\n     the app to use your device’s camera. \n\n 6.  Scan the QR code on the computer screen using your device’s camera. \n\n 7.  After scanning the code, click Next step on your computer.\n\n 8.  On your mobile device, select the account you’ve just added, and the app will provide you with a code. On your computer, type\n     this code into the provided space on the Classroom MFA setup screen.\n\n 9.  Click Done.\n\n 10. Click Exit settings. You’re all set.\n\n\nAfter this initial setup, when prompted to use Classroom MFA, you won’t need to scan a QR code: you’ll just open the Microsoft\nAuthenticator App and tap on the account you added. You’ll be provided with a numeric code to type into Clever. The code will\nchange every 30 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\nBIOMETRICS OR SECURITY KEY \n\nYou use a scanner on your device (like Apple Touch ID or Windows Hello) or an external device (like a Yubikey) to verify your\nidentity.\n\nSetup tips:\n\n * To access this option, you’ll need either a scanner on your device, or a physical key that your district provides each time you\n   need to verify your identity with Classroom MFA.\n * You can set up up to 4 biometrics or security keys (e.g., TouchID, FaceID, or 2 Yubikeys).\n\n\nSetup steps:\n\n 1. From the Classroom MFA setup screen, select Security Key.\n\n 2. You may see a prompt from your computer asking you which option you’d like. Select USB security key (or similar, the exact\n    wording varies by device). \n\n 3. Insert your Security key into your device. You may be asked to place your fingerprint on the key.\n\n 4. Classroom MFA will verify the biometric or security key and then verify that setup is complete.\n\n 5. Click Done.\n\n 6. Click Exit settings. You’re all set.\n\n\nAfter this initial setup, when prompted to use Classroom MFA, you’ll simply verify your identity by using the biometric or\nsecurity (such as scanning your finger, plugging in the Yubikey, etc.)\n\n \n\n\nBADGES\n\nYou scan a printed QR code via a device camera as a second factor after you have provided your password. \n\nSetup tip:\n\n * You do not need  a printer to download and use your MFA Badge! You can download your MFA Badge as a PDF, take a picture of it\n   on your mobile device or print it. \n\nSetup steps:\n\n 1. Go to your school or district's login screen (For example: Clever.com/in/district-URL) and sign in the way you normally do.\n\n\n\n 2. Select Badge \n\n\n\n 3. Click Download and print Badge (Remember our setup tip - you don’t need a printer!)\n\n\n\n 4. Once you have secured your Badge, click Next Step\n\n\n\n 5. Hold up your newly downloaded Clever MFA Badge to the camera. \n\n\n\n 6. You should now be logged into your Portal! \n\n\n\n \n\nSecurity tips for Badges:\n\n * Never post a picture of your Badge on social media \n * Don't leave your Badge unattended\n * When not using your Badge put it in a secured area\n * If you think your badge may have been compromised, void your Badge immediately and print a new one.\n\n\nVoiding and printing Badges\nThere are two ways to void a Badge:\n\n 1. If a teacher or staff user has more than one MFA method set up, they can delete the Badge themselves from their portal:\n    Teacher Portal > MFA settings > click on Badge under Your authentication methods > click Remove.\n 2. If a teacher or staff user only has the Badge setup and no other MFA method, then they will need to contact their Clever Admin\n    to reset MFA configurations for the user.\n\n \n\nTeachers and staff users can not reprint the same Badge. They need to go through the process above and click Remove to remove the\nBadge from MFA Settings, and then confirm that the Badge should be removed. \n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Add method and add a replacement Badge.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING CLASSROOM MFA AFTER SETUP\n\nAfter following the setup steps above, your district decides how frequently you’ll need to verify your identity using the\nadditional method(s) you set up. Currently, your district can require one of the following:\n\n 1. MFA is required every time you sign in to Clever\n 2. MFA is required once every seven days\n 3. MFA is required once every 30 days. \n\n \nIf your district has set Classroom MFA to be required every seven or 30 days, you can click the Remember me for {#} days checkbox\nwhen logging in via Classroom MFA, as shown in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n \n\nWhenever you are required to use Classroom MFA (be that every time, or every seven or 30 days), you’ll need access to one of the\nmethods you set up, be that your mobile device, a landline number you used to set up voice calls with, or your security key.\n\nYou won’t be able to access your Clever account if you don’t have access to one of the method(s) you use to set up MFA if you are\nprompted to use MFA. If this happens, click the Problems with MFA? button to access information on contacting your IT team for a\nbypass verification code.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Using backup login codes to support students\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article has information for teachers on how to help their students set up and troubleshoot Clever’s Classroom Multi-Factor\nAuthentication (Classroom MFA for short). As an optional add-on feature, Clever offers districts Classroom MFA to provide an extra\nlayer of security for student, teacher and instructional staff logins.\n\nYou’ll only have access to Classroom MFA if your district has added it to your district Clever account.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHELPING STUDENTS SET UP CLASSROOM MFA\n\nIf your school district requires Classroom MFA for students, they will need to activate this in order to log in to Clever. You can\nview which students haven’t activated their MFA by navigating to your Clever Portal > My Students > Student Roster.\n\nYou can find in-depth instructions for students to set up their Classroom MFA here: For Students: Setting up Classroom MFA. \n\nWe've also built a few resources to help you get your students set up with MFA:\n\n * Check out this slide deck you can use to walk students through the setup process! (for grades 1-4)\n\n * If you prefer to play a live video, you can show: Getting students setup on Classroom MFA\n\n * You can also use this Kahoot! to help students learn more about what MFA is and why it’s important.\n\n * You may also want to share our article, For Families: What’s Classroom MFA? with your student’s families to help them better\n   understand Classroom MFA.\n\nSeeing activation status\n\nIf the student hasn’t activated their Classroom MFA, you’ll see that indicated by their name in the student roster (as indicated\nin the red boxes).\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDOWNLOADING AND VOIDING YOUR CLASS MFA BADGES\n\nIf your students are using a Badge for Classroom MFA, you can download a class set of Badges by going to Clever Portal > My\nStudents > Student Roster > Selecting the class you wish to print badges for.\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nWhat if one of your students has lost their Classroom MFA Badge? No problem! You can void it and create a new one for them under\nStudent Tools (see red arrow in screenshot).\n\n\n\nThis will download a new MFA Badge to your device, which you can print out for the student. The next time the student logs in,\nthey will be prompted to follow a login flow to validate the badge.\n\nIf your student forgets their login MFA pictures, you can help students by reviewing their picture selections and helping them get\nlogged in or by initiating a reset of their picture selections from your Teacher Portal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING STUDENT MFA\n\n\nVIEWING STUDENT PICTURE MFA SELECTIONS\n\nIf a student forgets their login pictures, you have a couple options to support them in class. If you have time to personally\nsupport them and help them recall their login pictures, you can choose to reveal their pictures in your teacher portal. By\nrevealing the pictures you can then coach them on a way to better remember them like creating a fun, memorable story about the two\npictures. \n\n 1. Navigate to Student Roster from your Teacher Page > Click the student’s name > Click Show MFA pictures to review the pictures\n    to help your student get logged in on their own device\n    \n     \n\n 2. Click Hide MFA pictures once you are all set.\n    \n     \n\n\nRESETTING PICTURE, BADGE, AND PIN MFA\n\nAnother option you have to support students who can’t login with their MFA for some reason, is to do a reset of MFA methods. If\nyou reset a student’s MFA, they will need to go through the enrollment process all over again to log in. This will give them the\noption to select new login pictures, download and print a new Badge, or create a new PIN depending on the MFA policy they are in. \n\nReset may be a good option when a student has shared their login pictures with friends or if you don’t have time to individually\nsupport them. \n\n 1. Navigate to Student Roster from your Teacher Page, select the student, and Click Reset MFA.\n    \n     \n\n 2. Click Reset. \n    \n     \n\n 3. Your student will be prompted to reset their MFA pictures on their device.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING BACKUP LOGIN CODES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS\n\nIf your student cannot remember or lost their second authentication factor you will have the option to provide them with a\nshort-term backup login code. On the student’s login screen, they’ll need to select Can not login?\n\n\n\nThe student will then see the screen on which to enter their backup login code on their device:\n\n\n\n\nTO GENERATE A BACKUP CODE TO PROVIDE YOUR STUDENT:\n\n 1. From your Clever Portal, click the My Students drop-down on the left-hand side and select Student Roster   \n\n 2. Select the class the student is in from the Filter by class drop-down\n\n 3. Locate the student record from the list and click Get backup login code on the right-hand side  \n\n 4. A seven-digit backup code will be provided. Write this code down and pass it along securely to your student. The code will\n    expire in 15 minutes. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * For Teachers & Staff: Setting up Classroom MFA\n\n * For Students: Setting up Classroom MFA\n   \n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

FAQ\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn this article, you can learn more about what Classroom Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)  is, why your student’s school is\nrequiring it, and how your student will use it when logging into Clever. If you are experiencing any other issues, please contact\nyour student’s teacher for further assistance.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT'S CLASSROOM MFA?\n\nMFA enables users to log into programs by requiring them to verify their identity using two login methods (or factors). For\nexample, when logging into your online bank account, you may be prompted to enter your username and password, and then to verify\nyour login again by entering a text message code sent to your phone. This means you have used two factors to login! A username and\npassword and a text code.\n\nMFA enhances login security and can help prevent unknown logins to student accounts and exposure of sensitive student information\ncalled personally identifiable information (PII). It is considered to be an industry best-practice to implement MFA on digital\naccounts to avoid account compromise by bad actors. Many districts and schools are being required to implement MFA for greater\naccount and data security.\n\nClever’s Classroom MFA allows students to securely log into their Clever accounts using two different login methods (or factors)\nto ensure they are logging into the correct account. Depending on the school district’s settings, Classroom MFA may not\nnecessitate a second device, such as a cell phone, for verification. If your student’s school or district is using Clever’s\nClassroom MFA, your student may be required to use any of the following options that have been pre-selected by your\ndistrict/school: \n\n * Login pictures\n\n * Clever Badges\n\n * PIN (6 digits)\n\n * Authenticator app\n\n * Text message (SMS)\n\n * Voice call\n\n * Biometrics or security key \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW WILL MY STUDENT(S) USE CLASSROOM MFA?\n\nBased on the settings configured by your student’s district or school, they will either be prompted to set up their Classroom MFA\nfor the first time or, if they have previously set up their second factor, they will enter it when logging in.\n\nPlease check out this video for more information on Classroom MFA and the setup process for your student:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf your student is setting up Classroom MFA for the first time, they should follow these steps: \n\n 1. Go to their school or district's login screen (For example: Clever.com/in/district-URL) and sign in the way they normally\n    would.\n\n 2. They’ll be prompted to set up their additional login factor for Classroom MFA.\n\n 3. Once they have set up Classroom MFA they can use Clever as they normally would! Be sure your student doesn’t forget what they\n    set up - Clever may ask them again every time they log in, every seven days, or every 30 days depending on the school’s\n    requirements.\n\nFor more specific instructions to help your student set up Classroom MFA login pictures or Classroom MFA Badges please see our\narticle For Students: Setting up Classroom MFA. If you have questions about your student’s Classroom MFA options, please reach out\nto their teacher directly.\n\nIf your student has previously set up their Classroom MFA, they should follow these steps to login:\n\n 1. Go to their school or district's login screen (For example: Clever.com/in/district-URL) and sign in the way they normally\n    would.\n\n 2. They’ll be prompted to enter their additional login factor for Classroom MFA.\n\n 3. Once they have entered both login factors, they’ll be logged into their account! See the troubleshooting section below for\n    what to do if your student makes a mistake logging in, or forgets their second factor.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nIf your student is attempting to log into Clever with Classroom MFA and forgets their second factor or makes a mistake, they\nshould select Try Again.\n\n \nIf your student can’t remember how to login, they will need assistance from their teacher, or a guardian if your district has set\npermissions for families to help with MFA resets.\n\nFor help your student should select the Can not login? button pictured below. \n\n\n\nThe student will either be presented with a screen for a backup login code from their teacher, or if your district has enabled\nguardian support they’ll see the option to ask a teacher or a guardian for help.\n\n\n\nIf guardian support has not been enabled for your student's district.\n\n\n\nIf guardian support is enabled for your student's district.\n\nIf your student selects Ask guardian you will receive an email with a backup code to the email address that your student’s\ndistrict has on file. If you need to update this email address, please contact your school directly. The Clever team cannot update\nthis email address for you.\n\n \n\n\n\nIf your student selects Ask teacher, the teacher will need to provide a backup code to your student within 15 minutes for the\nstudent to login. If the teacher will not be able to provide a backup code within 15 minutes, please contact your student’s\nteacher directly for further assistance. If your student is able to receive a backup login code from their teacher they can enter\nit in the screen pictured below and click Log in.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWhat is MFA?\n\nMFA stands for Multi-factor authentication and is a login process that requires the user to enter two different pieces of\ninformation when logging in, for example, a username and password, and then entering a code sent to you via text message.\n\nHow often will my student be prompted to log into Clever with Classroom MFA?\n\nDepending on the settings your district configures, Clever may ask students for a second factor of authentication again every time\nthey log in, every seven days, or every 30 days.\n\nHow do I know what my student’s additional authentication factor is?\n\nWhen your student attempts to log into Clever, they’ll either be prompted to set up their additional factor for the first time, or\nthey’ll be prompted to enter a factor they’ve already set. For questions on the factors your student has available, or if they’ve\nforgotten any of their login credentials, please reach out to your student’s teacher directly.\n\nWhat if my student cannot get logged in?\n\nIf your student's district has configured settings so that you can help your student by providing them a one-time backup code,\nyour student may be able to request you receive this code at the email you provided to the school. Otherwise, please reach out to\nyour student’s teacher directly. The Clever Support team does not have access to your child’s login information for security\nreasons.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Using Classroom MFA Google Workspace SAML for Chromebook Logins\n\nPlease note: The Google Workspace app requires an MFA subscription.\n\nIf you're interested in adding MFA to your Clever account, you can learn more here or get started directly in your Dashboard >\nMFA.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article is a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up Google SAML with Clever's Classroom MFA.\n\nBefore reading this setup guide, please make sure your district is set up with Classroom MFA and Google! If your district has not\npurchased Classroom MFA, you can get started in your Dashboard > MFA here, or if you are new to Clever, get started by going to\nthis link: https://www.clever.com/district-signup. For more information on setting up Classroom MFA, please see this article.\n\nClassroom MFA protects the Clever Portal, Google Workspace, and Google Chromebooks. With the classroom-friendly MFA methods and\nthe ability to require re-authentication for login attempts outside your designated geographical location or network, you can rest\nassured that potential bad actors will hit your MFA wall and get turned away.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP\n\n 1. Search for the Google Workspace app and click Request Application. You can set up user sharing now or do so later.\n\n\n\n * If you’re getting a 404 error, copy and paste directly into the address bar:\n   https://schools.clever.com/applications/add/saml-google-workspace\n * If you already have this app installed and you don’t see the Request application button, go to step 2 below.\n\n \n\n 2. Share the Google Workspace app with any Clever users who need access to Google through Clever but don’t use Badges to access a\n    Chromebook. Typically, this includes older students, teachers, and staff users in Clever. Your students who use Badges to\n    access Chromebooks should not be shared with this app. Students who use Badges to access Chromebooks will use the Badge\n    configuration to access their Google accounts through Clever. Learn more here. \n    \n    \n    \n    Please note: Sharing the Google Workspace app with the same users in the Google OUs you will set up in step 9 below is\n    required for those users to successfully access Google from Clever.\n    \n    \n    \n\n 3. On the Google Workspace app page, click Settings. Scroll down to find the SAML Details section.\n\n\n\n \n\n 3. Go to your organization’s Google Admin SSO page by navigating to Admin console > Menu > Security > Authentication > SSO with\n    third party IdP. Click ADD SAML PROFILE:\n\n\n \n\n 4. Add Clever as an Identity Provider to your new Google SAML Profile by providing SAML information from the Clever dashboard\n    Google Workspace page (left) to the Google Admin New SAML SSO Profile (right):\n\na. Identity Provider Entity ID > IDP entity ID\nb. Copy Identity Provider ACS URL, add “?specify_auth=sis” to the end > Sign-in page URL\nc. Download Verification Certificate > Upload Certificate\nd. Make sure to add an SSO Profile name\ne. Click Save\n\n\n \n\n 5. Your new Google SSO Profile should now show your own SAML information.\n    \n     \n 6. In the Clever dashboard, on the Google Workspace page, click the Edit button under the SAML Details section, and provide SAML\n    information from the Google Admin New SAML SSO Profile (right) to the Clever dashboard Google Workspace page (left):\n\na. Entity ID > Entity ID\nb. ACS URL > Assertion Consumer Service URL\n\n\n\n \n\n 7. If needed, you can change the attribute mappings for any user type necessary. This is usually not required. Click Confirm to\n    finish setup.\n\n\n\n \n\n 8. From your new Google SSO Profile (screen in Step 5 above), click Back to return to your Google Admin SSO page. Next, assign\n    your new SSO Profile to an OU by scrolling down to the Manage SSO profile assignments section. You'll find one of two views:\n\na. If you’ve never set up an SSO assignment, click on GET STARTED:\n\nb. If you already have SSO assignments set up, click on Manage:\n\n\n\n \n\n 9. Select the intended OU in the left sidebar. Whatever OU you have successfully selected will be shown at the top of the\n    page. Please remember that the users in this OU must also be shared with the Google Workspace application (step 2 above) to\n    successfully access Google from Clever.\n\nIMPORTANT \nGoogle does not allow Superadmins to SSO via another IdP, so if you apply the Clever SSO profile you just made to a Superadmin at\nyour district, it will not work.\n\n\n\n \n 10. Next, click Another SSO profile, and in the dropdown, select the new SSO Profile you created in the above steps.\n\n\n \n 11. Make sure to Have Google prompt for their username… selected. Finally, click OVERRIDE to finish setup. That’s it, you’re all\n     set!\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: Once you have successfully set up the above steps, the user will need to log in with Clever Password to access their\nGoogle Workspace. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nUsers are looping between Google sign in and Clever without gaining access\n\n * This can sometimes be caused by the individual user setting in the Google Admin Console to force a password reset on the next\n   login. If your users are experiencing this, ensure the the Google Admin Console: Directory > Users > [Individual User] >\n   Security > Require password change is set to “off.” Also be sure that your Google account creation process is not automatically\n   setting this setting to “on” by default. Learn more here.\n\nGoogle Super Admins can’t use Clever SSO to access Google\n\n * This is a Google limitation. Google does not allow SSO access for Super Admin users. Learn more here.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING CLASSROOM MFA GOOGLE WORKSPACE SAML FOR CHROMEBOOK LOGINS\n\nTo secure Chromebook or Google account access with MFA, Clever must be set as the Identity Provider (IdP). This setup requires\nusing a non-Google login method, such as Clever Badges or Clever Passwords. Additionally, assign the user’s Organizational Unit\n(OU) to an SSO profile in Google that redirects authentication to Clever. These settings can be applied either globally or per OU.\n\nTo configure Chromebook logins with credentials and Classroom MFA, please follow these steps in your Google Admin Console to\nenable:\n\n * Clever to access the device camera on the login screen\n\n * Re-prompt for a Badge after the device is reopened after being closed\n\n * Sign the user into Clever automatically when they sign in to the device\n\n 1. Navigate to Devices > Chrome > Settings > Users & browsers and scroll down to the Security section\n\n 2. Set Lock Screen settings to: \"Do not allow locking screen\"\n    \n\n 3. Scroll a little bit until you reach the Single sign-on and SAML single sign-on login frequency settings in the Security\n    section.\n    \n    1. Set Single sign-on to \"Enable SAML-based single sign on for Chrome devices\".\n       \n    \n    2. Set SAML single sign-on login frequency to an appropriate duration. We recommend \"Every 2 weeks\" for the best experience.\n       \n\n 4. Scroll to the Power and Shutdown section. Set the following Idle settings\n\n * Set Action on lid close to \"Logout\"\n\n * Set Lock screen on sleep to \"Don't lock screen\"\n\n * Set AC idle action to \"Logout\"\n\n * Set Battery idle action to “Logout”\n\n\n\n 5. Next, scroll down to the Startup section further down on the same page\n    \n    1. Change the Homepage configuration to Homepage is always the URL set below. Set your Homepage URL to your Clever Portal URL.\n       You can find your Clever Portal URL here.\n       \n\n 6. Click the Device settings tab at the top of the settings panel and scroll down to Sign-in settings\n    \n\n 7. Set Guest Mode to \"Disable guest mode\"\n    \n\n 8. Set Sign-in Screen to \"Never show user names and photos\"\n\n\n\n 9.  Set Single Sign-On IdP Redirection to \"Allow users to go directly to SAML SSO IdP page\"\n     \n\n 10. Set Single Sign-On Cookie Behavior to \"Enable transfer of SAML SSO Cookies into user session\"\n      \n\n 11. Enter https://clever.com/oauth/badges/login under Single sign-on camera permissions. These settings ensure that Clever has\n     access to your Chromebooks' cameras to validate Clever Badge logins\n     \n\n 12. Scroll down to Kiosk Settings and ensure that Managed guest session is set to \"Do not allow managed guest sessions\"\n     \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * For District Admin: Classroom MFA overview\n * For District Admin: Classroom MFA setup\n * Adding Google SAML applications"

You can see which MFA version you have by\nnavigating the MFA page of your dashboard. This article is for MFA+, find Classroom MFA here.\n\nInterested in adding MFA to your Clever account, reach out to learn more here or get started directly in your Dashboard.\n\nIMPORTANT: \nIf you're looking for details on built-in MFA for Clever district administrators (AKA Clever Admin), click here!\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article walks through the setup process for Clever MFA+. For more information on how Clever MFA+ works, pricing, and FAQs,\nplease refer to this Help Center article.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo gain access to the free preview, reach out to our District Partnership team. Our team can help guide you to the right MFA\nsolution and activate a preview for you.\n\nIn this guide, we'll mention end users. End users are people who will use MFA while accessing Clever, like staff or teachers.\n\n\nSTEP 1: SELECT USERS\n\n * By Group\n   * All Teachers\n   * All Staff\n * Or by individual users\n\n\n\nIf you’re doing the Clever MFA+ free preview, you can start with a small subset of test users. To select a small subset of test\nusers, click Specific users and then select 2-3 teachers or staff members from the list, as shown in the screenshot above.\n\nLearn about the differences between Staff and Teacher users here. Note also that district administrators have some MFA options\nnatively built into Clever, which you can read about here.  \n\nYou’ll also need to ensure your test users all have Clever accounts so you can assign MFA to them during the setup process. If you\ndon’t know how to do that, reference this Help Center article.\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: SELECT MFA METHODS\n\nYou can choose multiple MFA methods for your end users to choose from. When an end user (e.g. teacher) sets up their MFA, they'll\nget a list of possible MFA methods to set up. In this step, you'll define what MFA methods will be displayed as possible methods\nto an end user.\n\nIt’s a good practice to have at least one other authentication method available to users so they can have a backup method. This\nway, if they are not able to use one method for any reason (e.g. their cell phone is not charged) they can use a backup method to\nsuccessfully log in. This saves time by providing an alternative to users.\n\n * Mobile app\n   * End-user uses an app that generates a verification code - a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). They'll use this code to\n     verify their identity during MFA.\n   * Choose an app that you recommend your end user should use to generate verification codes:\n     * Google Authenticator or\n     * Microsoft Microsoft Authenticator\n   * Authenticator apps are not dependent on wifi or internet networks to generate codes so these are great options for those with\n     network concerns.\n   * We recommend using this method as it has a good combination of security strength and convenience. \n * Biometrics or security key (e.g., Apple Touch ID, Windows Hello, Yubikey) \n   * End user uses a physical hardware key that plugs into the user device or is included in the device for authentication.\n   * Please note that Clever does not provide or re-sell hardware tokens. These must be district-provided. \n * Text message \n   * End user provides a phone number and receives a verification code by text message (SMS). Text message does not support\n     International numbers.\n * Voice\n   * End user provides a phone number and receives a verification code through an automatic voice message (call). Voice phone\n     numbers support extensions. Voice phone numbers do not support international numbers.\n * Badges\n   * End user scans a printed QR code via a device camera as a second factor after they provide their password.\n   * This authentication option is intended for use as a 2nd factor only with the use of Clever MFA+. For security purposes, we\n     are not at this time allowing teacher or staff users to use Badges as the primary form of authentication by replacing the\n     username and password. Badges as a 2nd factor complement a strong password but do not replace them. Badges alone are not\n     suitable for authenticating teacher and staff users because the permissions and access their accounts grant give them access\n     to student personally identifiable information (PII). \n\n\n\nSTEP 3: MFA SETTINGS\n\n * Enforcement date (required)\n   * End users will be prompted while logging into Clever to set up MFA two weeks before the enforcement date. They can skip the\n     MFA setup until the enforcement date. After that, an end user will be required to set up MFA before being able to access\n     Clever.\n   * When you select Skip enforcement date, it will make MFA optional for end users.\n * Re-authentication frequency (required)\n   * Select how often a user will be prompted to MFA while logging into Clever:\n     * Every time - end user has to use MFA every time they log in to Clever.\n     * Every 7 days - end user will use MFA every 7 days to log in to Clever.\n     * Every 30 days - end user will use MFA every 30 days to log in to Clever.\n   * Optionally, you can add more conditions to the “Every 7-day” and “Every 30 days” settings by clicking Advanced settings. \n\n\n * In Advanced settings, you'll define safe zones, where the end user will use MFA every X days to log in. End users outside\n   defined safe zones must re-authenticate every time. To define a safe zone use:\n   * Trusted user locations. Select country(s) where end users can log in every X days. \n   * User new location. When an end user logs in from a new location, they must log in with MFA.\n   * Trusted networks. Specify networks with CIDR blocks where end users can log in every X days.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSTEP 4: POLICY NAME\n\nChoose a distinctive policy name for each MFA policy. You can add an optional description of that policy, such as All staff at\nMeadowlark Elementary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 5: PREVIEW AND COMPLETE\n\nOn this page is a summary of all the selections you have made in previous steps. We recommend checking if everything is correct.\nIf yes, complete your MFA configuration. You can always come back and edit your MFA configuration by clicking on the MFA Policy\ntab.\n\nYou’ve now completed the configuration for apps in Clever with Clever MFA+! In Clever, you'll be taken to your Clever MFA+ setup\nguide to finish rolling out Clever MFA+ to your district and protecting all apps.\n\n\n\nNext, choose some services to integrate with Clever MFA+. You’ll be shown a few options to choose from on the dashboard page.\n\nFor the free preview, we currently support:\n\n * All Active Directory or ADFS-based logins \n * Google logins\n * Windows device logins\n\n \n\nPlease note: Clever MFA+ provides the highest level of account protection when it's used as the front door to log in to all apps\n(including email, SIS, instructional apps, etc.). Likewise, we recommend you use Clever Passwords as the Identity Provider for\nteachers and staff to log in to Clever.\n\nYou can learn more about setting Clever Passwords as the IDP for teachers and staff (and setting a different IDP for students, if\nyou wish) in this Help Center article.\n\n\nWe can support additional SSO application integrations via SAML, OpenIDConnect, or OAuth2. Request them during onboarding through\nyour implementation specialist. If an application is unable to support SAML or OpenIDconnect integrations, we can work with you to\nconfigure the app as a Saved Passwords app. While this won’t protect the app with MFA, it will simplify the login process for your\nend users.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING OTHER APPS\n\nWhen adding apps to your Clever Dashboard, we recommend using Clever SSO and/or SAML apps for the most secure experience.\n\nWhile you can use SSO (Saved Passwords) apps if a true integration isn't available, we recommend against using it if a Clever SSO\nor SAML integration is available. Keep in mind that as a Clever MFA+ customer, you can always request a new SAML connection from\nus, as well!\n\nThe primary reason is that SSO (Saved Passwords) is not as secure as true SSO integrations. SSO (Saved Passwords) works in the\nfollowing way:\n\n 1. The user's username and password for the target app are stored in Clever.\n\n 2. When the user clicks on a Saved Password app in Clever Portal, Clever supplies that user’s username and password to the app,\n    like a password vault.\n\n 3. The user logins directly to the app.\n\nAs such, the username and password are still in use. If a bad actor got access to the username and password, they can still access\nthe account directly from the app’s side. Using SSO (Saved Passwords) doesn't actually leverage Clever MFA+ to secure that app.\n\nConnecting an app via Clever SSO or SAML to Clever Portal guarantees that Clever Passwords and Clever MFA+ will protect every\nlogin to that app by every user.\n\nWhether the user is accessing the app via one-click SSO from Clever Portal or directly from the app side, Clever MFA+ will be part\nof the authentication process to access the app.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSER SELF-ENROLLMENT\n\nOnce within two weeks of the enforcement date of Clever MFA+ that you determined during admin setup, the users you have added to\nMFA will begin to see a setup box upon login (See an example here: https://clever.com/oauth/mfa/settings). They can follow the\nprompts to choose the best methods for them and after completion should immediately receive their first authentication prompt. \n\nUsers can choose to set up later if they wish, up until the enforcement date. \n\nFor the free preview of Clever MFA+, we recommend that all your test users immediately set it up to get the best window of\nexperience. You should be able to test by having them navigate to this page: https://clever.com/oauth/mfa/settings.\n\nFor in-depth information on the setup process of Clever MFA+ for end users, check out this Help Center article.\n\nTo ensure you have visibility into the activation status of your users, you can reference the user report on the Clever MFA+\ndashboard. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRESETTING MFA CONFIGURATIONS AND MFA BYPASS CODES\n\nIf you need to help one of your end users with MFA, you can go to the user's Profile page on the Clever Dashboard > Support Tools\n> and either click on Reset MFA Configurations for user or Generate MFA Bypass Code for user and follow the prompts.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  Related Articles: \n\n * For District Admin: Clever MFA+ overview\n * Badges into Chromebooks + Clever Multi-Factor Authentication (Clever MFA+) Setup Guide\n * For Teachers & Staff: Setting up Clever Multi-Factor Authentication (Clever MFA+)\n * Clever MFA+ and Biometrics\n * Clever IDM: Overview\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Identity Provider (IDP) Options\n * Single sign-on (SSO): Custom SAML connections\n * Clever SSO Policy"

Fill out the fields in the Create SAML connection box: \n\n * App name (required)\n * App logo (optional, must be .png and 200x200 px in dimension)\n * App website (optional)\n * Check off who will use the app\n\nNote: If you need to update any of these moving forward, you’ll need to contact Clever Support.    \n 3. Click Create. \n 4. Set up your rosters by clicking Begin setup on the Overview tab of the app. If you need help setting up rosters, review\n    Sharing Permissions: Overview.\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: We recommend setting up a temporary roster first that includes just a few test users. Otherwise, the new app will\nappear in user Portals immediately, but won't be functional until the SAML steps are completed.\n\n\nOnce your SAML application is set up, you can view it on the My applications page of your Dashboard.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONNECTING THE SAML APP WITH CLEVER\n\nAfter creating your SAML application, you’ll need to connect the app with Clever. To start the process, click on the app you just\ncreated on the My applications page as shown in the previous section.\n\n 1. Click on the Settings tab of the app\n 2. Scroll down and click the Set up connection button\n 3. Step 1: What you’ll need\n\nIn this step, you’re provided with the information to share with the application you’re connecting to Clever. Some of this\ninformation may not be needed by every app.\n\nIf you’re unsure of what’s required, contact the application’s support team, as Clever doesn’t have insight into each app’s unique\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n 4. Step 2: Create configuration\n\nIn this step, the easiest option is to obtain the metadata URL from the application. The metadata URL will auto-populate the\nconfiguration fields for you so that you don’t have to create the configuration manually.  \n\n\n\nIf the application you want to add does not have a metadata URL, you will need to create the configuration manually.\n \n 5. Step 3: Provide core SAML values\n\nNow, you’ll input the fields provided by the application. If you were able to use a metadata URL, the required fields in this step\nshould be input automatically.\n\n\n\nNot sure how to get these requirements? See our section on requesting required content.\n\n 6. Step 4: Define attributes\n\nThese are the SAML attributes for each user type which define how the app identifies a user.\n * The SAML attribute name is the identifier that the app requires. Examples include NameID, FirstName, and LastName.\n * The value is what Clever sends to the app for that attribute. Examples include FirstName, CleverID, Email, etc.\n\nWe mapped the most common attributes to values in Clever. If you don’t see the exact attribute name required by the app, just\nclick on the field and start typing to edit the name. If you require custom value, please contact our support team.\n \n 7. Step 5: Preview and complete.\n\nReview the core SAML values listed and if everything looks correct, click Complete connection. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSAMPLE EMAIL TO APP TO REQUEST REQUIRED CONTENT\n\nYou’ll need to obtain the required content to complete step 2 (Provide core SAML values) from the application. Often applications\nhave this information readily available and a simple internet search by typing the app’s name + SAML can provide documentation\nthat can help, or checking within the app’s configuration page.  If you can’t readily find the information, reach out to the app\ndirectly. We are providing an example email template for your use.\n\n \n\nSubject: Inquiry Regarding SAML Integration Possibility\n\nDear [app name] Support Team,\n\nI am reaching out on behalf of our school district, [district name]. We are exploring the possibility of setting up Single Sign-On\n(SSO) through Clever into your application by building a SAML connection to your app for our schools. I'm hoping you can provide\nme with your metadata URL. \n\nIf you aren't able to provide a metadata URL, kindly provide:\n\n * Assertion consumer service URL\n * And if available, the:\n   * SSO URL (if your service does not support IdP-initiated logins)\n   * Name ID format, and\n   * Entity ID\n\nWe are eager to ensure a seamless integration experience for our users. Your assistance is very much appreciated.\n\nThank you!\nBest, \n[your name]\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * For District Admin: Clever MFA+ overview\n * For District Admin: Clever MFA+ setup"

This article is for MFA+, find Classroom MFA here.\n\nInterested in adding MFA to your Clever account, reach out to learn more here or get started directly in your Dashboard.\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article provides information on biometrics (such as fingerprint or face scan) authentication options that can be used for\nClever MFA+. If you’re a teacher or staff member, please note that your district must turn on biometrics as an authentication\nmethod.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTYPES OF BIOMETRIC OPTIONS\n\nThere are many biometric options. Some of these options are built into your devices, but some require external hardware.\n\n\nPLATFORM AUTHENTICATORS\n\nThese biometric options are built into your devices like computers and smartphones. These devices can often be unlocked using\nbiometrics, such as a fingerprint with Touch ID, or your face with Windows Hello or Face ID.\n\n\nROAMING AUTHENTICATORS\n\nRoaming Authenticators are separate hardware authenticators that can be connected to your device in a number of ways. The most\ncommon ones connect through USB, Bluetooth or NFC. These are most commonly security keys like Yubikeys or Titan Keys.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBIOMETRIC OPTIONS: WHAT’S REQUIRED\n\nIf you’re unsure of compatibility of your device with a particular biometric option, you can do an internet search of that device\nname with the biometric option to see if they're compatible and what's required.\n\nSome things to consider include:\n\n * Do your operating system (OS) and browser support the biometric option?\n * A general check to make sure you have what’s required for the option you choose. Some examples:\n   * If using facial recognition, does your device have a webcam?  \n   * Does the device have a fingerprint scanner or can it support an external scanner as an option?\n   * If the hardware requires a USB, does your device have a port?\n\nBiometric optionRequired hardwareNotesFingerprint recognition\n * A fingerprint scanner built into your device or an external fingerprint scanner that can be attached to your device\n\nPros:\n * Very secure\n * Most people are familiar with this authentication method\n * External scanners are easy to obtain and relatively inexpensive\n\nCons:\n * If you injure your finger (such as a cut) it can interfere with the scan\n\n\n Facial recognition\n * A camera on your device\n * Facial recognition capability\n\nPros:\n * Very secure\n * Requires little interaction with the device\n\nCons:\n * Lighting can affect the performance\n * Facial expressions can potentially affect the performance\n * Use of facial accessories, such as glasses, may make it difficult to recognize the user\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * For District Admin: Clever MFA+ setup\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Step 2: Select MFA Methods\n\n\n  a. Select the authentication methods that will be available for users to choose from to access Clever Portal. We recommend the\nBiometrics/Security key as the most secure option, but it is good practice to have at least one other method available to users. \n\n\n 6. Step 3: MFA settings\n\n\na. Configure the enforcement for MFA, re-authentication frequency, and other advanced settings:\n * Enforcement Date: the date by which MFA setup will be required. This is an optional setting.\n * Re-authentication frequency and advanced settings: Select how often a user will be prompted to re-authenticate and any\n   additional advanced settings.\n\n\n \n 7. Step 4: Policy name\n\n\na. Choose a distinctive name for your first MFA policy. You can also add an optional description in this step. \n\n\n 8. Step 5: Preview and Complete\n\n\na. Preview the MFA configuration settings. If everything looks good, click Complete MFA configuration. \n\n\n \n\nFor each policy you would like to create, you will repeat this process until all desired policies are created.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMFA+ POLICY PRIORITY\n\nWhen you create multiple policies, you can see them displayed under the MFA Policy tab in priority order.\n\n\n\nIn the screenshot above, the Custom MFA Policy is listed first and the Staff MFA Policy is second because the staff policy is the\nnewest policy.\n\nThe order of the policies dictates which policy is used in the event that users are in multiple policies. When a new policy is\ncreated, it automatically goes to the lowest priority. You can adjust this by clicking on and dragging the policies on the left to\nadjust the order.\n\nFor users who are part of more than one policy, their MFA settings are dictated by the highest listed policy. As an example, if a\nuser is in Policy 1 and Policy 2, the MFA settings that are part of Policy 1 will apply to that user.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * For District Admin: Clever MFA+ overview\n * For District Admin: Clever MFA+ setup"

Many applications only need access to\nlimited data for their integrations. For example, some applications only require section data for specific subjects, while others\nonly need data for schools that have licenses. To resolve this issue, applications can create filters to ensure they receive only\nthe data they need, increasing data privacy and enhancing integration quality.\n\n \n\n\nHOW DO APP FILTERS WORK?\n\nStep 1: Districts share data with the application.\n\nStep 2: Applications apply filters on the district data to manage exactly which data they are receiving, whereby ensuring that\nonly relevant data is synced.\n\nPlease note that apps can still filter data even if you have app sync pause enabled\n\n \n\n\nHOW CAN WE TELL THAT DATA IS FILTERED?\n\nIf an app-side filter is applied to a district, the district will see an \"App Filters\" tab in the application area of the Clever\ndashboard.

Contact the application directly to determine the impact on user experience.\n \n\nTo resolve most data quality issues, simply adjust the data in your student information system (SIS). Once the updated data is\nreceived in your next sync, the data quality issue will be removed. \n\nIf you receive a data quality error about missing a specific field for all records: \n \n\n * SFTP syncs: Add the field to your CSV exports and upload the updated CSV files to Clever. Directions for formatting your data\n   files can be found here.\n    \n * SIS-managed Auto Sync: Reach out to your SIS and request that they add the field to your CSV exports. Once the updated data\n   files are received, the data quality error will be resolved. Directions for formatting your data files can be found here.\n    \n * Clever-managed Auto Sync: Contact our support team with the following information:\n   * Record Type: i.e. Student, Teacher, Sections, etc.\n   * Name of the field in Clever: i.e. Username, State ID, FRL_status\n   * The exact name of the field in your SIS"

Next steps to continue syncing your district’s data with an app on hold\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIf your district makes large changes to the data that is synced to Clever, we put a hold on the sync to make sure the changes are\nintentional. In a very similar fashion, if changes to your sync or the sharing permissions for an application would cause a large\npercentage of data shared with the app to change or be deleted, app-side safety thresholds will not allow that data to be synced\nto the application until a member of the app team has had a chance to review the data.\n \n\nApp-side safety thresholds are an important part of syncing rostering information as it ensures that both you and the app team are\naware of any potentially significant changes to your district’s data. Holds are a safeguard to prevent potentially incorrect or\nundesired changes from being synced to an application. \n\n\nSAFETY THRESHOLDS\n\nBy default, if your district’s most recent sync or an update in your sharing permissions results in over 75% of any data type\n(e.g. schools, students, teachers, sections) being updated or over 10% being deleted, an application safety hold will be\ntriggered. Some applications may set different safety thresholds in order to better support you. \n\nOnce a safety hold is approved, the district’s data will be fully available in Clever’s API for the application to pull. \n\n\n\nHOW TO KNOW IF YOUR DISTRICT-APP CONNECTION IS ON HOLD\n\nYou will know if your connection to an application is on hold based on the status of the application as seen on the homepage of\nyour district dashboard. If the application has a status of ‘Requires App Review’, then a hold has been placed on your district’s\nconnection to the application:\n \n\n\n \n\nBy navigating to the Overview page of the application, you can also view the application’s status:\n \n\n\n \n\n For a description of each of the possible application statuses, please see What's my application's status?\n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS TO CONTINUE SYNCING YOUR DISTRICT’S DATA WITH AN APP ON HOLD\n\nPlease reach out to the application’s team directly to work with their team on reviewing your district’s recent changes and\nreleasing the app-side hold."

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFor schools and districts that have set up Clever as an IDP into Google, using our Google SSO apps can provide a better Google\nlogin experience than using the Saved Passwords version of those applications. Google SSO apps work on all devices.\n\nIn this article, we’ll review the requirements and best practices for configuring Google SSO apps. \n\n\nWHICH GOOGLE SSO APPS ARE AVAILABLE\n\n * Gmail\n\n * Google Calendar\n\n * Google Classroom\n\n * Google Drive\n\n * Google Docs\n\n * Google Keep\n\n * Google Meet\n\n * Google Sheets\n\n * Google Slides\n\n\nInterested in deep-diving into how to best use Clever and Google together? Check out our course, Clever & Google: Secure Connected\nClassroom Certification available in Clever Academy!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Google SSO applications require configuring a SAML connection between your Clever account and your Google workspace. You can\nconfigure this SAML connection in 3 ways.\n\n 1. Setting up Clever as the organization-wide SSO Provider in your Google Admin Console. Learn about this setup in our article\n    Single Sign-On (SSO): Setting up Badges into Chromebooks and Chromebook logins with Clever as your organization-wide SSO\n    Provider.\n\n 2. Setting up Clever an SSO Profile in Google. Learn about this setup in our article Single Sign-On: Setting up Clever Badges and\n    Chromebook logins with Clever as an SSO Profile in Google.\n 3. The Google Workspace app for districts with a Clever MFA subscription - see configuration instructions here: For Clever\n    Admins: Clever MFA Google Workspace SAML Setup Guide.\n\nSetting up Clever as your organization-wide SSO provider is the simplest configuration. If you have not already set up one of the\nabove SAML connections, you will need to do so before proceeding.\n\nIf you configure more than one SAML connection for different users, ensure that the sharing permissions for the Chromebook Login\nfor SSO Profiles or Google Workspace apps match the OU enrollment in your Google workspace. The individual Google SSO apps will\nuse the same SAML connection that is configured for that user. Only share Google SSO apps with users who have a SAML connection.\nYou can share the Google SSO apps with all users that have a working SAML connection regardless of which SAML connection that user\nutilizes.\n\nIMPORTANT If using on shared iOS devices with native Google apps, ensure that users explicitly log out of all Google accounts\nwithin the apps. If users do not explicitly log out, the Google session will remain accessible on the shared device within those\napps.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING GOOGLE SSO APPLICATIONS\n\nAdding a Google SSO applications is easily done from your Clever Dashboard. \n\n 1. Go to the Add applications page and search for the Google SSO application you’d like to add. Ensure that you are not selecting\n    the Saved Passwords version of the application.\n\n\n \n 2. Send the integration request.\n 3. Confirm that you have completed the SAML Connection.\n 4. The application should now have the status of Launched in the Applications table. Please see this article to understand the\n    application's status.  Remember that your sharing rules for the application must include users in OUs managed by Clever in\n    your Google Workspace in order for the logins to be successful.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nWhy use Google SAML rather than a Saved Passwords version of the app?\n\n * The SAML app can be a better choice because: \n   \n   * With the SSO version, you don’t have to set up the user's credentials. Users are automatically logged in when they click on\n     the icon in their Clever Portal. \n   \n   * With the SSO version, there is less room for error when users log in the first time.\n   \n   * SAML connections are a secure industry standard for performing SSO\n\nIs there ever a situation where we should choose the Saved Passwords version?\n\n * No. Once configured, the Google SSO apps provide a superior experience. \n\nDoes this work with Clever's Google Workspace app, which is included with Clever MFA?\n\n * Yes. These Google SSO apps will work for any users who use the Clever Google Workspace app to access Google. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\n * Single sign-on (SSO): Setting up Badges into Chromebooks and Chromebook logins with Clever as your organization-wide SSO\n   Provider\n * Single sign-on (SSO): Setting up Clever Badges and Chromebook logins with Clever as an SSO Profile in Google\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Setting up Clever Badges and Chromebook logins with Clever as an SSO Profile in Google\n * For Clever Admins: Clever MFA Google Workspace SAML Setup Guide\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Chromebooks - Troubleshooting\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Viewing the data being shared with an app\n6. Editing app sharing permissions\n7. FAQs\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW \n\nWith the Sharing Permissions feature in Clever, you are able to share the exact users who need access to an application in Clever.\nWhether your whole district/school uses the application or just a handful of users (e.g. four 3rd grade math sections), you will\nbe able to share the application with just the users who need to have access to the resource from their Clever Portal. This also\nallows you, the district admin, to be in full control of what the application receives from Clever to roster and maintain your\nusers' accounts. \n\nWe know that not all applications are utilized by the same subset of users, so you are able to set up sharing permissions on an\napp-by-app basis.  Sharing permissions are often set up for each unique application based on the application type, licensing\ncontingencies, and so on.\n\n \n\nPlease note: District Admins are shared by default with all connected learning applications. Staff, Teachers, and Students must be\nexplicitly shared with each application in order for data to be shared for each account type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT DATA IS SHARED WITH APPS?\n\nClever provides each application with only the data necessary for its operation. District admins can view and modify what data is\nbeing shared by navigating to their Clever Dashboard > Home page, and then clicking on the application's name to open the app\noverview page. Here, you can click the download icons next to each data type to see the exact data the application is receiving. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGUIDED VS STANDARD SHARING VIEW\n\nThe first step when setting up your sharing permissions is to determine which setup view you’d like to use. Clever offers two\noptions for sharing your data, Guided Sharing or Standard Sharing. The choice is up to you based on which view is easier for you\nto operate!\n\n * Guided Sharing is best for new users or those who don't set up sharing settings often. As it guides you through the process\n   with prompts and examples.\n\n * Standard sharing is best for experienced Clever users or those who need to use School Site Sharing.\n\nUsers can choose to switch between these two experiences at any time by selecting Edit Sharing for an application and selecting\nSwitch Sharing setup view in the top-right. Your choice in sharing experience will be remembered and used anytime you edit sharing\npermissions for an app.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSHARING DATA WITH AN APP\n\nWhen starting to share data with your applications, it’s important to understand the sharing permission options to make sure you\nare only sharing the users who need access. Review the 6 different options below:\n\n * App’s recommended sharing: Applications can recommend sharing settings to communicate sharing best practices directly to your\n   district in the Clever Dashboard. If the application has recommended sharing permissions, they will display when you are\n   setting up sharing. Use these recommendations as a starting place for determining your district's sharing permissions. \n * Share by District: All district data in Clever will be synced to the application. This includes district admins, schools,\n   teachers, students, staff, and sections.  \n * Share by Schools: Clever will only share any data associated with the school(s) you've selected (e.g. students, teachers,\n   sections, staff). \n * Share by Rules: Clever will only share data that meets the specific criteria you've set. This is the most recommended sharing\n   type as it provides districts with the flexibility in determining specifically what data should be included, or excluded, in\n   the sharing. Read this article to learn more about how to Share by Rules!\n * School Site Sharing: If your district has designated School Tech Leads in Clever, you can provide them with the ability to\n   configure application sharing permissions for their associated schools. More info here!\n * Copy Sharing: Copy the sharing permissions from another application that has already been set up. \n\nTo see step-by-step directions on how to set up your sharing permissions for apps that you have added, check out this article. We\nalso understand that sharing permissions can be kinda tricky to think through, so make sure to also check out our sharing\npermission tips and tricks! \n\nOnce you share data with the application, the application will dynamically update based on the sharing permissions configured. As\na new record meets the sharing criteria, please allow up to 24 hours for the record to be created in the application. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVIEWING THE DATA BEING SHARED WITH AN APP\n\nOnce you've configured your sharing permissions for an application, you have the option to download CSV files containing the\nschools, students, teachers, staff, and sections that are being shared with the application through Clever. By default, district\nadmins are always shared with applications!\n\nNavigate to your Clever Dashboard > Home page, and then click on the application's name to open their overview page. \n\nThe Application Receives files only provide a few basic details about the records shared with them. They may have access to\nadditional fields for each record based on your field access settings. For example, the students.csv does not include the student\nemail address, but the application partner might be receiving student email addresses. For details on which data is synced to\napplications for each record, visit: What data is available to my connected applications?\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEDITING APP SHARING PERMISSIONS\n\nTo edit sharing permissions, from your Clever Dashboard > Home page, click on the application's name to open their overview page. \nThen, select Edit sharing under the Shared Data section.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions about setting up your sharing permissions, or what data is being shared with your district applications,\nplease reach out to Clever support! We are happy to help!\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nFAQS\n\n\n\nWHY IS CLEVER UNABLE TO DISPLAY THE COUNT OF SHARED RECORDS?\n\n\n         \n\n * Shared Data: This box provides a summary of the data being shared based on the application sharing permissions you have set.\n * Filters: Some application partners implement filters on their end to filter the data being shared with them. If any filters are\n   set for your district, they will show in the Filters box in the middle of the app overview page.  For more information, please\n   visit: What are app filters?\n * Application Receives:  Click the blue download arrow icon to the right of the data type (schools, students, teachers, staff, or\n   sections) to download a more detailed list of the data being shared.  The numbers in this box are a combination of the data\n   your district has shared along with the filters the app partner has put in place.    \n * Clever may be unable to provide a preview of the count of shared records for districts with large data sets or highly complex\n   rules. When this occurs, \"Unable to display count of shared records\" or \"Sorry, your rules are too complex to display shared\n   records\" may display. \n * To view the count of shared records, please use the Application Receives section on the app overview page. \n\n\nHOW DO I ADD NCES IDS AND/OR MDR NUMBERS FOR SCHOOLS IN CLEVER?\n\n * Reach out to our support team and provide a list of the numbers/IDs that need to be added and their corresponding schools. \n\n\nHOW DO I CHECK TO SEE WHICH SCHOOL IS BEING SHARED AS THE USERS’ PRIMARY LOCATION? \n\n * For one-off users, you can search for the user in the search bar of your Clever Dashboard to locate their profile and look at\n   their primary school site. \n\n\n\nFor multiple users, you can click on the application in your Clever Dashboard and click the download button under Application\nReceives for the user type in question.\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO I SHARE CO-TEACHERS WITH APPLICATIONS?\n\n * First, be sure to ask the application if they support co-teachers, as some applications don’t. If they confirm that they do\n   support syncing co-teachers, check in Clever to ensure that they are added to the correct sections. To learn more about adding\n   co-teachers in Clever, check out this article. Once you have confirmed they are co-teachers to sections in Clever and the\n   application supports co-teachers, they will be shared as long as they meet the sharing permission criteria set up for the\n   application. \n\n\nWHY ISN’T THE USER SHARED WITH THE APP? \n\n * Sharing permissions can be tricky! Check out our tips & troubleshooting article to help guide you to make sure the user is\n   shared. \n\n\nTHE DATA IS CORRECT IN CLEVER, BUT IS NOT CORRECT IN THE APP. WHAT DO I DO?\n\n * This could be happening for various reasons, so it’s important to make sure everything checks out. Check out our app\n   troubleshooting article to guide you in troubleshooting the issue.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n * Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules\n * Sharing Permissions: Guided Sharing"

Reverting to previous rules/Viewing who made changes\n6. Multiple sharing rules and filters\n7. Adding Notes\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBy configuring sharing permissions for applications, district admins can determine what data will be shared with each district\napp, and which district users will be able to access the application from their individual Clever Portals.\n\n\nWhen sharing by rules, Clever will only share data that meets the specific criteria you've set. This is the most recommended\nsharing type as it provides districts with the flexibility in determining specifically what data should be included, or excluded,\nin the sharing. \n\n\nAdditionally, applications are dynamically updated as new data is synced to Clever from your district's student information system\n(SIS). The data shared with the application via sharing rules evolves based on the new data in Clever.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n For an overview of application sharing permissions, please visit:  Sharing Permissions: Sharing data with applications\n\n   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A SHARING RULE?\n\nA sharing rule allows districts to be specific about what data is being shared by data type (e.g. teacher, student, section,\netc.). Once a sharing type is selected, district admins can continue to add filters to ensure only the data they want shared with\napplications is being shared.\n\n\nFor example, sharing rules might include:\n \n\n * All the math classes in a particular school\n * The math classes for grades 3-6 in the district, except for in two schools\n * One specific teacher’s 11th grade homeroom class\n\n\nThink of a sharing rule as a sentence:\n \n\n * \"Share all records where <attribute> <is one of> <value>”\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCHOOSING SHARING BY RULES AS A SHARING TYPE\n\nYou can view and edit your sharing rules from your Clever Dashboard by clicking on the application's name to open the Overview\ntab.\n\n 1. Click Edit Sharing\n\n\n \n 2.  If you're not already Sharing By Rules, you can change the sharing type to Sharing By Rules by clicking on Change as shown\n    below (in this example the school district was Sharing by Schools).\n\n\n \n 3. After choosing Sharing By Rules you will then be prompted to choose which method you want to use (e.g. Custom Share by\n    Student):\n\n\n \n 4. Create your rules and filters. Click here to learn more about the different types of rules and filters. For sharing rule\n    recommendations, be sure to check out our tips & troubleshooting article.\n 5. After creating each rule, select Done editing\n 6. Once you have finished adding all of your rules and filters, select Save Sharing Rules\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I ADD OR EDIT A SHARING RULE?\n\nIf you're already using Share by Rules, go to your Clever Dashboard and click on the application name to open the app overview\npage. From the app overview page, click Edit Sharing.\n\nUse the Edit or Delete actions to update your sharing rules.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nCONSTRUCTING SHARING RULES\n\n\n\nTYPES OF SHARING RULES\n\nThere are a few types of sharing rules available: \n\n \n\nSharing rule\n\nPurpose\n\nCustom Share by TeacherShare specific teachers by one of their unique identifiers (e.g. email address, teacher ID).\n * When sharing by teacher, you'll have the option to select if you want to share their associated student and section data.\n   Custom Share by Teacher sharing rules will not share student contacts, however.\n\nCustom Share by StaffShare your non-instructional staff. If Sharing by staff, you will have the option to select if you want to\nshare their school associations. Clever recommends sharing \"all associated schools.\" This will not share additional students,\nteachers, or sections.Custom Share by Student Use this sharing type to filter by student attributes such as grade, gender,\nELL_status, IEP, status, etc.\n\n * When sharing by student, you'll have the option to select if you want to share their associated section data.\n\nCustom Share by SectionUse this sharing type to filter by section attributes such as subject, school, course, and term.\n\n\nFILTERS\n\nRules are made up of Filters. A Filter is an individual requirement that must be met in order for a record to be shared. A rule\nmay have multiple filters\n\nFilters are created by creating a statement using the following:\n\n * Properties are attributes that districts can use to either include or exclude data with the application sharing rules. The\n   fields available are dependent on the type of sharing rule you selected (e.g. share by teacher, share by section, share by\n   student)\n * Operators define how the property should be used. Available operators are:\n   * equals any of\n   * does not equal any of\n   * contains\n   * does not contain\n   * contains any of\n   * starts with\n   * starts with any of\n * Values are the actual values that the rule must meet in order to be shared. Values can be selected manually from the dropdown\n   or by pasting multiple values separated by a semi-colon. Search for values is case-sensitive\n\nNote: When using the School or Schools properties, you may enter or paste lists with any combination of school names, school\nsis_ids, or school Clever ids.\n\n\nIn the below example, the filter has a requirement that a section has the subject of math in order to be shared:\n\n  \nIn this example, the filter is excluding any sections with the subject of PE and Health by using the does not equal operator. This\nmeans that every section with a subject other than PE and Health will be shared with the application. \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREVERTING TO PREVIOUS RULES/VIEWING WHO MADE CHANGES\n\nBy clicking on the Past rules tab on the application's page, you can view the sharing rules history, including the date and time\nthe rules were changed and who changed them.  Under the Past rules tab, you can click on View current rules (1) to see the current\nsharing rules and view the sharing rules history by date and time. By clicking on one of the small arrows next to the time (2), it\nwill open up to show you what the sharing rules were previously. You can revert a previous rule set by clicking on Revert to these\nrules (3). \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMULTIPLE SHARING RULES AND FILTERS\n\nAn application can have an unlimited number of sharing rules. In the below example, the application has two rules. A record will\nbe shared with the app if it meets the requirements for either rule: \n\n * Rule #1 (Share by section)\n   * Filter #1: School equal any of Discovery Middle School\n   * Filter #2: Subject equals any of Math\n\nIn Rule #1 a section must meet both filter requirements in order for the section to be shared. \n \n * Rule #2 (Share by student)\n   * Filter #1: Grade equal any of 3;4;5\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: When you have multiple rules, the two rules are mutually exclusive. So, if you want to build off the existing rule,\nyou'll want to add a filter to the rule itself rather than create a new rule entirely.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nADDING NOTES\n\nTo help keep sharing permissions organized, Clever provides the ability for users to add Notes to sharing rules. \n\nTo add a note to a sharing rule, click Add Note. Enter your note and click Save. Notes support up to 500 characters. Once saved,\nthe note will appear on the sharing rule. In addition, the note will display the date, time, and user that last updated the note. \n\n\n\n\nTo edit a note, click Edit Note. Any Clever Admin may edit an existing note, even if created by another user."

Your choice in sharing experience will be remembered and used anytime you\nedit sharing permissions for an app.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nGUIDED SHARING\n\n\n \n\n\nCHOOSE SHARING METHOD\n\nYou have options for how to share data: (the different types of sharing are mutually exclusive, you cannot choose two):\n\n * Specific sections, teachers, students, and/or staff: Clever will only share data that meets the specific criteria you've set.\n   This is the most recommended sharing type as it provides districts with the flexibility in determining specifically what data\n   should be included, or excluded, in the sharing. Read this article to learn more about this sharing option.\n\n \n * Everyone in specific schools: Clever will only share any data associated with the schools you've selected (e.g. students,\n   teachers, sections, staff). \n\n \n * Everyone in my district: All district data in Clever will be synced to the application. This includes district admins, schools,\n   teachers, students, staff and sections. \n\n \n * Use an application’s suggested data sharing template: Some applications have set general recommendations for how to share data.\n   You can view the recommendation and see if it’s a good fit for you.\n\n \n * Use an application’s customized data sharing template for your district: In addition to general recommendations, sometimes an\n   application team member will create a custom recommendation for your district. You can view the recommendation and see if it’s\n   a good fit for you.\n\n \n * Copy another app’s data sharing rules: If you’ve already set up sharing with another application and want to apply the same\n   settings to this application, you can select this option. Read this article to learn more about copying sharing!\n\n\nThe data shared with the application will dynamically update based on the sharing permissions configured. As a new record meets\nthe sharing criteria, please allow up to 24 hours for the record to be created in the application. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCHOOSE WHO NEEDS ACCESS\n\nIn Step 2, you will select which users to share with an application using the selected sharing method. \n\nFor additional information on using the various sharing methods, please see these articles: \n\n * Specific sections, teachers, students, and/or staff\n * Use an application’s customized data sharing template for your district\n * Copy another app's data sharing rules\n\nOnce the desired data is shared, click Next\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPREVIEW & SHARE USER DATA\n\nIn Step 3 you can preview the records that will be shared by your data sharing settings. Clever provides both the total number of\nshared records as well as a table of the individual records that will be shared with the application. \n\nAfter you have reviewed the shared records for accuracy, click Share with application. The data is now successfully shared with\nthe application! \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDATA VALIDATION\n\nMany applications set data errors and warnings to flag potential data issues that will affect students and teachers. If any data\nerrors or warnings are triggered, they will display on this page. For more information on data errors and warnings, please see\nthis article. \n\nWhen ready to proceed, click Next\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFINALIZE SETUP\n\nSome applications will provide additional instructions for finalizing setup for their application. If any final instructions have\nbeen provided, they will be surfaced here. Also listed on this page is the date when the application will be available to users in\nthe Clever Portal.

Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWith Google Classroom roster import, you can get straight to learning without worrying about the extra work that goes into getting\nyour students set up in their Google Classroom courses!\n\nOnce your school sets up the application via Clever, you will no longer need to create classes manually in Google Classroom. Your\nClassrooms will automatically be created based on your SIS and Clever data.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS GOOGLE CLASSROOM ROSTER IMPORT?\n\nGoogle Classroom roster import is an application allowing your district to connect data from Clever to your Google Classroom\naccounts. This means your Google Classroom course names will match Clever section names, and rosters will update automatically as\nyou or your students change classrooms. We save you time by taking these time-consuming tasks off your plate!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DOES GOOGLE CLASSROOM ROSTER IMPORT WORK?\n\nGoogle Classroom roster import will be connected to Clever by your district administrator. Once a sync has completed your Google\nClassroom accounts will be updated with course data that exists within Clever.

Let your teachers know what to expect!\n5. Monitor the sync history page for errors and successfully-synced data\n6. Steps to take as-needed\n7. Bulk Archive Tool\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nGoogle Classroom roster import makes setting up courses in Google Classroom easier than ever for school-year rollover! We’ve\ncreated this guide to help ensure that you’re set up for a smooth semester or summer term rollover with Google Classroom roster\nimport. \n\nIf you’re new to using roster import, be sure to accept your invite and initiate your sync first! You can find an overview of the\nintegration here, and our full setup guide here.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: PLAN FOR ROLLOVER: PAUSE AND ACCESS DATES, AND COURSE ARCHIVING\n\nWhen a district's student information system's (SIS) data rolls over to the new semester or school year, courses are synced\nautomatically with Google Classroom once they are active in Clever and shared with Google Classroom roster import. Once a\ndistrict approves its SIS sync hold and rolls over to the new semester’s rostering data in Clever, those shared sections will\ncreate corresponding courses in Google Classroom! \n\n \n\nPlease note:  If sections are removed from your SIS and Clever account, it won't result in the corresponding Google Classroom\ncourse being removed from Google Classroom. The course will remain active unless one of the following occurs:\n- A Clever Admin archives the section using the Bulk Archive Tool\n- The section is archived or deleted by the teacher or a Clever Admin \n- The section is archived in bulk via Google Apps Manager\n\n\n\n\nHowever, districts can delay syncing new courses to Google Classroom by pausing their Google Classroom sync and setting teacher\nand student access dates. Please note that this pause is separate from any pauses to a district's SIS sync to Clever. To pause\nyour district's Google Classroom sync, please follow these steps:\n\n * Navigate to the Settings tab of your Google Classroom roster import application.\n * Add a start for your pause. Clever will stop syncing new information to Google Classroom when your start date arrives. Pausing\n   will not remove or change any existing data in Google Classroom. To pause the sync immediately, set the start date to today. By\n   default, the pause start date for Summer 2024 is set to May 31, 2024.\n * Add access to dates for teachers and students.\n   * Teachers will see courses when the teacher access date arrives, allowing them to prepare for the upcoming semester.\n   * Students will be added to courses on the student access date, allowing them to see the courses teachers have accepted.\n   * If you would like students to see courses as soon as teachers accept them, you can set the access dates to the same day. \n   * The sync will run for each user type at 12:30 AM PST/3:30 AM EST on the corresponding access date\n * Select the Update option to save the pause start date and access dates.\n * By default the pause end dates for teachers and students were set to your SIS sync pause end dates.\n\nPlease select the Clear option to unpause the sync, and the Google Classroom roster import will begin syncing again for both\nteachers and students.\n\n\n\nThe Google Classroom roster import sync pause is a great tool to use if your district does not want students to see their courses\nin Google Classroom before schedules are officially announced. Simply set a teacher access date for the day schedules are updated\nin Clever and set a student access date for the day your district schedule will be released.\n\nPlease note that previously created courses that are no longer shared can be archived using the Bulk Archive Tool. \n \n\nClever Tip:  For additional tips on preventing students from viewing their schedules prematurely in\nClever, please visit this article detailing Clever's Access Control feature. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: REVIEW SHARING RULES\n\nNavigate to your district's sharing rules for Google Classroom roster import. Do the sharing rules you have in place now work for\nthe coming semester’s data as well? This is a great time to ensure that your district is sharing all necessary courses with Google\nClassroom. Need help with sharing rules? Clever Support can help.\n\nMany districts prefer to share only the current term's sections to avoid confusion for their teachers. See the term rollover\narticle for more information.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: LET YOUR TEACHERS KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT!\n\nThis is one of the most important steps! For a great rollout, make sure your teachers know the following three things:\n\n 1. When they should see courses populated in Google Classroom (and what they look like - see below). Google Classroom courses\n    should be synced within about an hour after your teacher access date arrives.\n 2. When students will be added to those courses. If your student access date is after your teacher access date, make sure to let\n    teachers know when students will be added - so they don't add them on their own and are prepared for when they appear! \n 3. That they need to \"accept\" courses for them to be editable and visible to students. Courses that aren't accepted will not be\n    visible to anyone except their primary teacher. \n\n\n \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: MONITOR THE SYNC HISTORY PAGE FOR ERRORS AND SUCCESSFULLY-SYNCED DATA\n\nNavigate to the Sync History page for Google Classroom roster import to monitor the courses that are being created and updated. Be\nsure to review any sync error reports, including the reason and resolution for any sync issues.\n \n\n Please note: When sections match, we may or may not have updated the class. It'll also show as an update, but this doesn't mean\nthat anything changed. It's just indicating that it is the new current state of the Google Classroom class.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTEPS TO TAKE AS-NEEDED \n\n\n\nREPROVISION ANY COURSES THAT TEACHERS DECLINED BY ACCIDENT\n\nBe sure to let your teachers know that they need to accept the synced courses in Google Classroom! If you need to reprovision any\ncourses that teachers declined by accident, Clever Admins can do that from the section's profile page in the Clever Dashboard:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCUSTOMIZE COURSE NAMES\n\nIf the default naming convention or a previous year’s customized naming convention needs to be changed during rollover, you can\nutilize the course naming tool from the Google Classroom roster import settings page in your Clever Dashboard. These changes will\nonly be reflected in courses created in future syncs and will not overwrite previously synced courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBULK ARCHIVE TOOL\n\nThe Bulk Archive Tool in Google Workspace offers a streamlined way to manage your courses by allowing you to archive multiple\ncourses at once, preventing your Google Classroom from getting cluttered with old courses that are no longer in use. This tool is\nespecially useful during term rollovers or when you need to tidy up your Google Classroom environment. This tool will only allow\nyou to archive courses that Clever created.\n\nBulk archive cannot archive sections while they are still shared with the Google Classroom Roster Import application. If you need\nto archive a section shared with this application, you must first update the sharing permissions to exclude it from sharing. Once\nthis is done, you can proceed with archiving the section using the Bulk Archive Tool.\n\nThe Bulk Archive preview allows you to see which courses are no longer shared with Google Classroom Roster Import. This ensures\nthat you archive only the courses that are ready to be archived.\n\n \n\nTo begin using the Bulk Archive Tool, follow these steps:\n\n 1. Navigate to the Google Classroom Roster Import application > Settings > Courses bulk archive\n\n 2. Adjust the course creation dates so that the tool archives any sections that were created in Clever during a specific time\n    period. The start and end date filters for creation date will use your Time Zone and start at 12:00am and end at 11:59pm on\n    the dates selected. \n\n 3. Click Preview if you would like to see which sections you will archive. This is an optional step.\n\n 4. Click Archive when you are ready to archive all courses created by Clever within the specified dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAMPLE EMAIL TEMPLATE\n\nBefore archiving sections, we recommend that you reach out to your teachers to let them know what will take place. Here’s an email\ntemplate that you can use: \n\nSubject line: Upcoming Google Classroom Archiving\n\nDear Teachers,\n\nWe hope this message finds you well.\n\n[School District] has archived  classes within Google Classroom to help reduce clutter and ensure you no longer see outdated\nclasses. This change will affect Google Classroom courses that were automatically created between  [From Date] and [To Date].\nPlease note that this will only impact classes automatically created, not classes you created.\n\nIf you need to unarchive any classes, you can follow the instructions listed here.\n\nShould you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact [insert school Clever admin name or email address].\n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\n[Name]\n\n[Title]\n\n[School District]\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Clever + Google Classroom: Overview\n * Clever + Google Classroom: Setup guide\n * Clever + Google Classroom: Requirements & Troubleshooting\n * For Teachers: Clever + Google Classroom"

Turning off Library\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Clever Library is a place for teachers to discover, learn about, and adopt new resources for their classrooms. Resources in\nthe Library can be added to a teacher’s Teacher Page for easy access by students and teachers.\n\nAs a Clever Admin, you can recommend particular resources to your teachers, promote them in the Library, and encourage teachers to\nadopt them, and you can also block resources if necessary.\n\nWhen a teacher adopts a Library application with SSO, Clever shares only the absolute minimum information: student first name,\nlast initial, grade level, and course enrollment.\n\nClever does not share any sensitive information with Library applications, including student number, SIS ID, email, state ID,\nschool/district information, or any demographic information about the student.\n\n \n\n\nRECOMMENDING RESOURCES\n\nTo recommend resources, go to Clever Dashboard > Applications > Teacher installs.\n\nYour recommendations will be highlighted with your district’s branding, so in order to recommend resources, we suggest adding a\ndistrict abbreviation. Choose an abbreviation that will be recognizable to teachers - for example, Clever Unified School District\nmight use the abbreviation “CUSD”.\n\nRecommend a resource by searching for it by name. We also encourage adding notes to your recommendations to highlight to teachers\nwhy and for what purpose a resource is recommended. You may also delete a recommendation at any time.\n\n\n \n\n Please note: The Clever Library is a place for teachers to find and adopt resources - therefore, the only resources that can be\nrecommended are those that support teacher sign-ups. School or district-adopted resources, such as Dreambox, Lexia, or iReady, are\nnot available in the Library.\n\n\nIf you’d like to recommend a resource that is not yet in the Library, send us a note at library-suggestions@clever.com with the\nname and URL so that we can create the appropriate entry.\n\n \n\n\nHOW RECOMMENDATIONS APPEAR TO TEACHERS\n\nResources that are recommended will appear front and center when a teacher visits the Library.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a teacher visits a recommended resource, your recommendation and associated notes are featured prominently. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nVIEWING LIBRARY INSTALLS\n\nTo view applications that have been installed by teachers, navigate to Applications > Teacher installs. Here you will be able to\nview the number of installs, and logins by application. \n\nTo view installs with greater detail, scroll to the bottom and select Export teacher install data\n\n\n\nThe information provided in the downloadable CSV is described below:\n\nField\n\nDescription\n\nteacher_idThe Clever ID of the teacher that installed the resourcefirst_nameThe first name of the teacher that installed the\nresourcelast_nameThe last name of the teacher that installed the resourceemailThe email address of the teacher that installed the\nresourceschoolThe school of the teacher that installed the resourceapp_idThe Clever ID of the resource installedapp_nameThe name\nof the installed resourceinstall_dateThe date the teacher added the resource\n\n\n \n\n\nBLOCKING RESOURCES\n\nIf there are particular resources that your district prohibits, you may also add them to a block list. For instance, if your\ndistrict firewall blocks specific websites, you may block them in the Library as well. Blocking a resource will remove the\nresource from all pages where a teacher is browsing resources. Please note that currently there is no way to move to an \"allow\nlist\"; we only support a block list.\n\nIf a teacher searches for or tries to install a blocked resource, they will be shown the message below explaining that the\nresource is blocked, along with any editors’ notes that you add explaining your rationale.\n\n\n\nIf a teacher installed the resource was added by a teacher before being blocked by the district, the teacher and their students\nwill retain access to the resource. If you would like the resource removed for users, please contact Clever Support. However,\nbefore Clever disables this feature, please send a communication to district teachers alerting them to the upcoming changes to\nClever. Once teachers have been informed, Clever Support will securely remove the Library resource(s) from their Clever Portals. \n\nTo edit the list of resources currently being blocked by your district or to block specific resources, please navigate to the\nClever Dashboard > Applications > Library Settings tab and select View Block List. Blocking a resource does require the Clever\nAdmin to input a note explaining why the resource is blocked, which will be shown to teachers when they search for or try to\ninstall it.\n\nNote: Blocking a resource does not prevent teachers or students from going around the safety of the Clever Portal and accessing\nthe resource directly.\n\n \n\n\nTURNING OFF LIBRARY\n\nIf your district would like to disable all Library data sharing, you can do so by navigating to Clever Dashboard > Applications\n> Library Settings > Settings. At the bottom, you will see the option to Disable Clever Library\n\nWe will request that communication be sent to teachers to alert them of the upcoming changes to their accounts. Once complete, our\nteam will securely remove the Library resources from their Clever Portal."

Clever consolidates these requests in one place to help district administrators keep track of the\napps teachers want to upgrade.\n\n\nTo facilitate high-quality purchase requests, we prompt teachers to write their thoughts on the following:\n \n\n 1. How are you using this resource today?\n 2. How has it impacted your students? \n 3. How would an upgrade support your instruction?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I VIEW TEACHER PURCHASE REQUESTS?\n\nView in your dashboard: View purchase requests by visiting the App Store in your dashboard.

Students\n            •  Getting Started\n            •  Creating a New Account\n            •  Logging into an Existing Account (13 years and older)\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n Khan Academy can now be found in the Clever Library for free! The Clever Library is a place for teachers to discover, learn\nabout, and adopt new resources for their classrooms.\n\nTeachers that have access to Clever and the Library can install Khan Academy and gain the benefit of automatic rostering of their\nclasses for them, and their students gain Single Sign-on (SSO), so no new user name or password to remember! If your district uses\nClever, you’ll have access to these benefits whether you’re new to Khan Academy or already using us.\n\nThis article is for teachers new to using Clever with Khan Academy. If you already use our old integration via Clever, follow the\ninstructions in our help article Transitioning to Clever Library from old Khan district implementation instead.\n\nBelow are the steps for new or existing Teachers and Students to get started via Clever Library. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTEACHERS: GETTING STARTED\n\nLog in to Clever, choose the Library tab at the top, and find Khan Academy by browsing or using the search bar at the top of the\nLibrary. You can also find Khan Academy in the publicly accessible Clever Library and then log in.\n\n\n\nNext, click on the blue Install button for Khan Academy. \n\nAfter installing, click on the Khan Academy logo tile in your portal.\n\n\n\nWhen you first install Khan Academy, you’ll be asked to confirm that you want to share your class data with Khan Academy:\n\n\n\nThen you’ll be asked whether you want to create a new Khan Academy account, or if you already have an existing school account you\nwant to use:\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTEACHERS: CREATING A NEW ACCOUNT\n\nIf you don’t already have a Khan Academy account through your school, click Create a new account, confirm or enter your school\nemail, and then click Sign up. \n\n\n\nThis will create your new account, and your classes will automatically be rostered for you (this can take a few minutes the first\ntime). After the rostering process is complete, you’ll be taken to your Teacher Dashboard:\n\n\n\nYou can also go to the Khan Academy website and sign up directly. To do this, click on the Sign up link in the upper right corner\nof the home page, and then choose the sign up as a Teacher button. Click on the Continue with Clever:\n\n\n\nIf you choose that option and are already logged into Clever, you’ll be asked to confirm that you want to share your class data\nwith Khan Academy:\n\n\n\n If you’re not logged into Clever, you’ll be asked to do that first.\n\n\n\nThere’s one final step you’ll want to complete if you’re creating a new Khan Academy account via Clever Library, which is to\nverify the email you provided when you signed up. You’ll receive an email that looks like this:\n\n\n\nClick on the Link this email address button in the email. You’ll be brought to the Khan Academy login screen; click on the\nContinue with Clever option: \n\n\n\nThis will enable you to verify your email with us, which will add it to your Settings under Email.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTEACHERS: LOGGING INTO AN EXISTING ACCOUNT\n\nIf you already have a Khan Academy account through your school, click Log into your existing account. You can log in to that\nexisting account using Google (click on Continue with Google) or by entering your school email address and your password.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve logged into your Khan Academy account, you’ll be taken to your Teacher Dashboard, where you’ll see your\nClever-rostered classes, as well as any other classes you had previously created. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTUDENT REGISTRATION AFTER CLASS CREATION\n\nNote that there is no class code, and you should not give one out; your students need to complete their registration by logging\ninto Clever and choosing the Khan Academy tile in their portal, then go through the steps to create or sign into their account.\n\nOnce in your Teacher Dashboard, you’ll see that, your classes have been created and your students have been rostered, but the\nclass student count will show as zero. Once your students complete their registration and access the Khan Academy through the\nClever portal, you’ll see them in your Student Roster as normal.\n\nUntil then, if you select one of your newly rostered classes, you’ll see that the students are listed as pending:\n\n\n\nPlease also note there is no class code, and you should not give one out; your students need to complete their registration by\nlogging into Clever and choosing the Khan Academy tile in their portal, then go through the steps to create or sign into their\naccount.\n\nOnce your students have completed this process, the number of students in your Khan Academy class(es) will match what you see in\nClever for your roster and you will be able to give them assignments or mastery goals. This is easy to do; to start assigning you\njust open “Assignments” and select “Assign” in the left-hand navigation and you’ll be asked to add a course, like this:\n\n\n\nIf your students haven’t completed signup by logging into Clever and choosing the Khan Academy tile, they won’t be reflected in\nyour student count, and they’ll still show as pending in your Student Roster.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING\n\nThere are a few other helpful things to know about how Khan Academy works with the Clever Library:\n \n\n\nSYNCING WITH CLEVER\n\nYour student and class data in Khan Academy will sync with your Clever roster each time you log into your Khan Academy account, so\nif you’re missing updates, try logging out and back in again. \n\nInformation only syncs one way, from your school district’s SIS to Clever to Khan Academy. In other words, the Clever roster\n“rules”; we consider your Clever roster the source of truth. This means that any student additions made to your district or\nschools’ SIS will flow through to Clever, and then on to Khan Academy, and you should not take any additional action in Khan\nAcademy to add students. Additions to your rosters will automatically refresh the next time you log in. \n\nKhan Academy receives very limited data on your students (first name and last initial only, and no email via the roster data).\nThis means that you will see limited data on your students in your Teacher Dashboard, and email address updates made in Clever\nwon’t flow through to Khan Academy.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTUDENTS: HOW DO MY STUDENTS GET STARTED WITH KHAN ACADEMY THROUGH THE CLEVER LIBRARY?\n\nSince the Clever Library is for teachers to discover applications they may want to use with their classes, students don’t have\naccess to it directly.\n\nStudents see the Khan Academy tile in their student portal (through your teacher’s page) after you’ve found Khan Academy in the\nClever Library, installed it, and completed your activation process. It’ll look something like this: \n\n\n\nStudents can favorite Khan Academy so it’s easy to find within their portal, and also search for it within their portal. Once your\nstudents find Khan Academy in their student portal, they select the tile to begin their activation process. \n\nThey’ll be able to create a new account for Khan Academy or (if they’re 13 or older) log into an existing school account (a Khan\nAcademy account that has their school email associated with it).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTUDENTS: CREATING A NEW ACCOUNT\n\nThe first time a student selects the Khan Academy tile, they’ll see a welcome message urging them to create a new account or log\ninto their existing account. \n\n\n\nThey’ll be asked to enter their birth date and to sign up with their school email.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter they’ve clicked Sign up, they’ll be taken to their newly-created account, and their Clever ID will be attached to their\naccount (this is behind the scenes, but helpful for understanding how it works).\n\nThey’ll see a welcome message that will explain that they won’t see anything to do on their Learner homepage until their teacher\n(you!) has made an assignment.\n\n\n\nWhen they dismiss the message by clicking Onward, they’ll see their Learner home, ready to display your class once you give\nassignments.\n\n\n\nIf the student chooses Teachers (the bottom option in the left-hand navigation bar) they’ll see you linked as their teacher\n(specifically, your first name and last initial) which validates that they have completed their part of the process, and can wait\nfor you to give them an assignment.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSTUDENTS: LOGGING INTO AN EXISTING ACCOUNT (13 YEARS AND OLDER)\n\nStudents who are 13 years of age or older have the option to use an existing Khan Academy school account instead of creating a new\none. To do this, they’ll choose the bottom option Log in to your existing account.\n\n\n\nThen they’ll enter the school email address and password for their account:\n\n\n\nOur system will check that the account belongs to a student who is at least 13 years old. If the account belongs to a student who\nisn’t at least 13 years old, the system will recognize that they are attempting to use an under 13 account, and they’ll receive an\nerror message directing them to go back and create a new account instead.\n\nIf the student is indeed at least 13 years old, they’ll see a screen asking for permission to link their Clever account to their\nKhan Academy account, like this:\n\n\n\nThe message will explain that by using their existing account, all teachers linked to it will be able to see any activity on\nassignments, as well as any activity they’ve done independently (outside of a class). \n\nThey’ll either sign in or create a new account, and then they’ll be brought to their Learner Home in Khan Academy."

You’ll work with our Partner Engineering team to configure the settings on your IdP to allow for seamless logins using the\nLog in with SSO button found at apps.clever.com.\n\n \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nTeam Review\n\n * Please review your current app team to ensure that you have accounts for the correct users. To view your team, navigate to the\n   Team section of your Clever dashboard.\n * It is required that the email addresses associated with user accounts in Clever match the email addresses associated with\n   accounts in your IdP.\n\n\nOrganization Review\n\n * If your team administers multiple apps on Clever or your organization spans multiple email domains, you may need Multiple\n   Domain support. To prepare for App Dashboard SSO across your organization, ensure that the correct users have user accounts\n   created with all of the appropriate applications in Clever using credentials that align with the IdP you intend to use for App\n   Dashboard SSO.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nTo get started:\nIf you would like to configure single sign-on for your organization, please contact our team at integrations@clever.com with the\nfollowing information:\n\nEmail Domain:\n\n * This will be the @ of your email address. ex: At Clever, our email address has a “clever.com” domain.\n\n\nEncrypted Assertion?:\n\n * Will the SAML assertions that their IdP sends to Clever be encrypted or unencrypted?\n\n\nmetadata.xml Info:\n\n * This can either be provided via an URL (recommended) or a file.\n * Your metadata info must include the following information:\n   * EntityDescriptor with an Entity ID\n   * KeyDescriptor tag that includes the X509Certificate\n   * SingleSignOnService tag with HTTP-Redirect Binding\n\n\nConfiguration Steps to take In your IdP:\n\n 1.

Add a SAML assertion attribute “clever.email” that is mapped to email addresses in your IdP. Please note that the email\n    addresses in your IdP will need to match the email addresses in Clever.\n\n\nOur integrations team will contact you with next steps to complete the configuration.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMULTIPLE DOMAINS\n\nApp Dashboard SSO can now support multiple email domains across the same organization. This will allow you to set up App Dashboard\nSSO across all of your applications. Reach out to integrations@clever.com to explore your options.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWhich IdPs can we use as our SSO Provider for App Dashboard SSO?\n\n * Any IdP that can set up a SAML connection will work. See your IdP documentation for IdP-specific instructions on configuring\n   the SAML connection.\n\n\nWill dashboard logins using email and password continue to work?\n\n * Dashboard logins will continue to work through the configuration and transition period and when you are ready to fully\n   transition to App Dashboard SSO, we will disable logins using email and password.\n\n\nWe have a Third-party development team that needs access, but we don’t have them as part of our SSO org.

Sharing Program Status: Setup Process\n4. Frequently Asked Questions\n5. Support Contacts\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBefore reading this guide, please ensure your district is set up with Clever and that you've added the NWEA MAP Growth app to your\ndistrict's Clever account!\n\nIf your district hasn't been set up with Clever, you can get started by going to this link: clever.com/signup. For more\ninformation on setting up Clever for the first time, please see this guide.\n\nA District Admin must add the application in Clever. To add the NWEA MAP Growth app, search NWEA MAP Growth in the search bar of\nyour Clever account.\n\nWhen it comes to rostering for NWEA MAP Growth with Clever, one of the most common requests from districts is for the capability\nto summarize test results by program (e.g., 504, IEP, special ed, etc.). \n\nTo address this need, the MAP system supports importing program designations from Clever, making program data available in several\nMAP Growth reports.  The “Sharing Program Status: Setup Process” section of this article explains how to share programs from\nClever to NWEA MAP Growth.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nCheck the Data Quality tab of the NWEA MAP Growth app in your Clever Dashboard to see whether you’re meeting the required data\nfields. NWEA MAP Growth requires the following data fields to be sent:\n \nStudent:\n\n * sis_id\n * name\n * district\n * school(s)\n * grade\n * race\n * gender\n * dob\n * hispanic_ethnicity\n * state_id (if you’re using NWEA as part of a state program)\n * frl_status, iep_status, ell_status and extension fields are optional\n\nTeacher:\n\n * district\n * name\n * school(s)\n * sis_id\n * email\n * state_id (if you’re using NWEA as part of a state program)\n\nIf you’re using NWEA as part of a state program, you may have additional fields required by your state, including but not limited\nto the state_id field at the school level. Please see your state program documentation for the fields required by your state.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\n\nSHARING PROGRAM STATUS: SETUP PROCESS\n\nIf you’d like to import program designations from Clever into MAP, please read the following setup process.\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: FIND THE MAP CUSTOM NAMES FOR THE PROGRAMS YOU'LL SYNC \n\nWhen Clever sends program data to MAP (e.g., if a student is an ELL), the MAP system will attempt to import the data using the MAP\nCustom Names for the programs you’ve defined. Therefore, a good first step is to identify the MAP Custom Names that are already\nentered the MAP system (if any).\n \n\n\nTo find the Custom Names for the programs in your district: \n\n 1. Log in to MAP at teach.mapnwea.org.\n 2. In the left navigation menu, click Modify Preferences > Modify District. \n 3. Scroll to the Programs section. A list of programs showing the NWEA Standard Name and Custom Name appears.  \n 4. Note the Custom Names for programs you want to sync using Clever.\n\nPlease keep in mind:\n\n * The NWEA Standard Name isn't used to match program data from Clever. \n * The Custom Name is the name that shows on reports. \n * It's possible for multiple Custom Names to have the same NWEA Standard Name, and it's also possible for the Custom Name to be\n   identical to the NWEA Standard Name.  \n * If you need a program added (such as Individualized Education Plan (IEP)) that isn't a default value in the MAP System, you'll\n   need to add the program in NWEA if you want this program data to sync from Clever. Follow these steps:\n\n 1. In the left navigation menu of NWEA, select Modify Preferences > Modify District.\n 2. Click Add Program, then select Other as the Standard Name and paste the program name, like \"Individualized Education Plan\n    (IEP)\" into the Custom Name text field.\n 3. Click Submit to save.\n\n \n\n\nSTEP 2: LEARN ABOUT CLEVER STANDARD FIELDS\n\nClever has three standard fields that are pre-populated in the Clever system.\n\n 1. ell_status\n 2. frl_status\n 3. iep_status \n\nThese three Clever standard fields, if shared with the MAP System, will automatically link up with the following MAP Custom Names\nif the MAP Custom Names are present in your MAP system (see chart below). \n\n\nThis table provides an overview of values in Clever and what you would see in the MAP System under Modify Preferences > Modify\nDistrict.\n\n \n\n\nSTEP 3: IDENTIFY IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY OR CREATE NEW EXTENSION FIELDS IN CLEVER\n\nNow that you understand that Clever has three default fields that align with a small handful of common school programs, you can\ndetermine if you need to add or modify extension fields in Clever to identify additional programs in your school (e.g., talented &\ngifted, after-school classes, etc.).\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to compare the extension fields in Clever to the list of MAP Custom Names:\n\n * If the extension fields in Clever perfectly match (including spelling and punctuation) the list of MAP Custom Names, then no\n   action is needed, and your data should transfer accurately.\n * If you have extension fields in Clever (e.g., Talented & Gifted) that aren't on the list of MAP Custom Names, you will need to\n   create new MAP Custom Names to match these extension fields.\n * If you have MAP Custom Names (e.g., After School Program) that don't have a matching Clever extension field, you will need to\n   create a new (or modify a current) extension field to match the MAP Custom.\n\nPlease note: The extension fields in Clever must perfectly match the MAP Custom Name (including spelling and punctuation).\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: CREATING NEW EXTENSION FIELDS IN CLEVER\n\nYou can create new extension fields in Clever by following the directions in this Help Center article. The exact process will\ndepend on the sync type you have set up to connect your Student Information System (SIS) to Clever.\n \nIf you need help syncing the data from your SIS into Clever in the correct format, contact Clever Support by clicking the blue\nchat box in the bottom right corner of the Help Center.\n\nThe names of the Clever extension fields that the MAP system accepts are listed in the right-hand column in the table below. The\ndata you'll enter in the CSV file to assign a particular student to a program will be the exact Custom Name of the program you\nhave listed in the MAP system. \n\n\n\n\nLet's look at an example of students who are assigned different programs in Clever (via extension fields) that will then be sent\nover to MAP as a Standard Name or Custom Name:\n\n \n \nIn the above example, you see that:\n\n * Student 123 will be assigned to two programs in MAP: the Remote Learning program and the Gifted and Talented program.\n * Student 456 will also be assigned to the Remote Learning program, as well as the Section 504 program.\n * Student 789 is assigned to two programs in MAP: the Remote Learning and Economically Disadvantaged programs.\n\n \n\n\nSTEP 5: SHARE DATA WITH NWEA\n\nNow that the data is synced to Clever, you can share the data with NWEA. The instructions for sharing custom fields in Clever can\nbe found here.\n \nSince these fields are considered sensitive, you must provide special permission for Clever to share these fields with MAP. Refer\nto For District Admins: Syncing Sensitive Fields (i.e., ELL status, IEP status, FRL status) for instructions.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nCan I add multiple “other” programs as Clever Extension Fields? \n\n * For example, a district might have a program with a Custom Name in MAP called “Volleyball” and another program with a Custom\n   Name called “Economically Disadvantaged”.\n\nYou can add multiple \"other\" extension fields! If you're using a CSV file to upload your extension fields, you'll simply list all\nof the extension fields for the student within the ext.other column, separating each field with a comma, as shown in this example,\na student with sis_id 789 is assigned Remote Learning and Economically Disadvantaged:\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have multiple programs that might match a different custom field name (such as ELL)? \n\n * If no students will ever be assigned to both programs (for example, a district might have “ELL Spanish” and “ELL Arabic”\n   programs and students can only ever be assigned to 1 of these at most), then you can use the same custom field in Clever for\n   both. The student assigned to, for example, ELL Spanish, should have “ELL Spanish” as the value for the ext.ell field, while\n   the student assigned to ELL Arabic will have “ELL Arabic” in that field. \n\nThe only field that NWEA will accept multiple values for the same student is ext.other. So if there is a chance that a student\nwill be assigned to multiple programs that could have the same custom field name in Clever, you should use another field such as\nthe ext.other field for these programs instead. The ext.other field will accept comma-separated values. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSUPPORT CONTACTS\n\nNWEA MAP Growth\ntechsupport@nwea.org\n\nClever\nSupport.clever.com (click Contact Support)\nContact Clever with issues that relate to:\n\n * Setting up sharing rules\n * Syncing required and optional fields to Clever \n * Customizing field access"

Open eBooks is a mobile and web app that provides thousands of popular and\naward-winning books free for students in Title I schools. These eBooks can be read without checkouts or holds.\n\nThe goal? To address the challenge of providing digital reading materials to children living in low-­income households—and to\nencourage a love of reading.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSETTING UP OPEN EBOOKS\n\nAfter the district administrator has added Open eBooks on Clever, Students enrolled in Title I schools can download Open eBooks\nand access books for free from their mobile device.\n\n\nFirst, District Admins add Open eBooks in the Clever Dashboard   \n\nStep 1: Log into your Clever dashboard\n\n\nStep 2: Request Open eBooks  \n\n\nStep 3: Scope the entire district with the application.\n\n \n\n Please note: The Open eBooks application is NOT added to the Clever Portal because it's only available to Title 1 Schools. You\ncan create a custom login link to students' Clever Portal by following these Clever instructions and using the Open eBooks logo\nbelow. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOWNLOADING OPEN EBOOKS ON MOBILE DEVICES \n\nThis is the best option for students who can download applications onto mobile devices on Android and/or iOS. Downloading the\napplication requires app store credentials that each school or student must get independently of Open eBooks. \n\nThis is also the best option for students who wants to download books and access them even without internet access.\n\n\n\n \n\nStep 1: On an iPhone or Android phone, open the app store and type in “open ebooks”\n\n \n\nStep 2: Click GET then click INSTALL to download the app.\n\n\n\n \n\nStep 3: Open the app and click Sign in with Clever.\n\n \n\nStep 4: Search for the student’s school district to sign in with their username and password. \n\n \n\n Please note: Students will need app store credentials independent of Open eBooks.\n\n\n \n\n\nACCESSING OPEN EBOOKS VIA OUR WEBSITE ON ANY DEVICE\n\nThis is the best option for students who cannot download applications onto a device. This is also the best option for students who\nhave access to a browser, and an internet connection. \n\n\n\nStep 1: On a Chromebook, laptop, desktop or mobile device visit www.openebooks.org and click Sign in. \n\n \n\nStep 2: Click Sign in with Clever to sign into the collection.\n\n \n\nStep 3: Search for the student’s school district to sign in with their username and password. \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\n\nWHO CAN PARTICIPATE?\n\n * Any student who is in a school or library program that serves at least 70% of children from in-need families.\n   * Title I or Title I eligible School (must be school-wide program)\n   * Library program with an E-rate of 90\n   * A school primarily serving children with disabilities\n\nWhat devices work?\n\n * Children can read eBooks on a wide variety of devices—including Chromebooks, laptops, desktop computers, tablets, iPads, and on\n   smartphones of all types.\n\n\nHow do I get this turned on for my school?\n\n * Your district IT administrator must request Open eBooks via the Clever dashboard and then share data with the application. Once\n   the application has been added and data has been shared, your students can download the application on their mobile device and\n   begin accessing Open eBooks from school or home. Students should click Login with Clever, choose their school, and enter their\n   Clever login credentials.\n\nRemember, in order to use the Clever Login your school must have a valid NCES ID and the school must be both a \"Title I School\"\nand a \"Title I School-Wide Program\". You can check your school's Title I status at the NCES website. Just search for your school\nusing its NCES ID (or other information). If your school doesn't have \"Yes\" for both those fields, you may still be able to access\nOpen eBooks using First Book.\n\n\nWhere is this application available?\n\n * The Open eBooks mobile application is available for download on Android and iOS devices (mobile phones and tablets) on the\n   device app store. \n\nOpen eBooks is also available at www.openebooks.org for Chromebooks, laptops, desktop computers, as well as being available in\ntablets and mobile devices by using the device’s browser application.\n\n\nWhy don’t I see Open eBooks in my Clever portal?\n\n * The Open eBooks application is NOT added to the Clever Portal because it is only available to Title 1 Schools. You can create a\n   custom login link to students' Clever Portal by following these Clever instructions and using the Open eBooks logo.\n   Additionally, students are able to:\n   1. Use their Clever Single Sign-On credentials to log into Open eBooks at www.openebooks.org, where they can use the web\n      reader, or\n   2. Download the iOS or Android app to any mobile device and use their Clever credentials to sign in and start reading.\n * You can also add a custom login link to students' Clever Portal by following these directions. \n\n\nDoes Open eBooks work for students with special needs?\n\n * Special Education classrooms can get access to Open eBooks, regardless of their Title 1 status. Open eBooks and Clever are\n   compatible with Apple and Android’s Text to Speech (TTS) and supports Open Dyslexia Font.\n\n\nCan I scope by reading level rather than grade?\n\n * No, Open eBooks cannot be scoped by reading level. However, the Elementary collection is sorted into 7 different Guided Reading\n   Level (ATOS) lists to help students find the right fit book anytime, anywhere (note: books without a publisher-assigned Lexile\n   level are not included in the Guided Reading Level title lists).\n\n\nAre there books in other languages?\n\n * There are currently books in Spanish, and Open eBooks is working on bringing on titles in other languages.\n\n\nDoes this work on Chromebooks?\n\n * Yes! Open eBooks now works on all Chromebooks in any web browser by visiting www.openebooks.org.\n\n\nWhat data elements are used?\n\n * Open eBooks uses an extremely limited data set to authenticate a student. The only elements the Open eBook server stores are\n   the student's clever id and grade bucket (elementary, middle, or high).\n\n\nDoes Open eBooks support teacher/administrator logins?\n\n * Teachers can use their Clever username and password to access Open eBooks, but at this time they have access to the same\n   features as students.\n\n\nWhat happens when a school changes from First Book Login to Clever login?\n\n * The access codes and accounts between First Book and Clever are distinct, and so student checkouts won't transfer. Also,\n   remember: Clever can't be used for those students receiving Title 1 benefits on an individual basis, Clever only does school\n   registration.\n\n\nIs there a delay between when the district admin adds Open eBooks and when the students can access the app?\n\n * No. Open eBooks is an Instant Login application and does not roster through Clever. Because Open eBooks isn't creating accounts\n   or syncing data with Clever, students should be able to access the application almost instantly.\n\n\nWhat content will each student see?\n\n * There are 3 content clusters: elementary, middle, high school. The student will see the content appropriate for the grade they\n   are in. For example, a 7th grade student will see middle school content, regardless of reading level.\n\n\nIs there another way to access Open eBooks besides Clever?\n\n * Yes! There is an alternative method - educators can sign up for access codes through First Book. Visit the First Book website\n   for information and to sign up.\n\n\nCan students use Badges to access Open eBooks?\n\n * No.\n\n\nCan we remove the badge on the login screen?\n\n * It’s the same login screen for the portal - so if we were to remove the badge from Open eBooks, it would also be removed from\n   the application.\n\n\nDoes Open eBooks support screen reading technology?\n\n * On mobile devices, Open eBooks support VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android. For desktop-based screen readers, Open eBooks\n   supports 3rd party screen readers such as VoiceOver on Mac and JAWS and NVDA on Windows.\n\n\nIs my school eligible if we get Title 1 targeted funding?\n\n * No, Open eBooks is only available to schools that get school wide Title I funds. \n\n\nHow do users log out of Open Ebooks so that another user can access the app on the same device? Is there a link or special step to\ncomplete to log out of the identity provider?\n\n * Within the app, a student can logout by clicking the three dots that say more at the bottom right hand side of the application.\n   Then clicking on account and then on the red sign out button on the bottom.\n\n\nHow do I know if my school has Title I status?\n\n * You can check your school's Title I status at the NCES website. Just search for your school using its NCES ID (or other\n   information). In order to use the Clever Login, the school must be both a \"Title I School\" and a \"Title I School-Wide Program\".\n * If your school doesn't have \"Yes\" for both those fields, you may still be able to access Open eBooks using First Book.\n\n\nI have a few students who qualify for free-and-reduced-lunch, but am not in a Title 1 school, can those students get access to\nOpen eBooks?\n\n * Yes! Educators and librarians can sign up for access codes through First Book. Visit the First Book website to sign up!\n\n\nWhat titles are available?\n\n * There isn't a list of titles available as the collection continues to grow. Open eBooks features thousands of titles generously\n   contributed by major publishers on a rolling basis.\n\n\nHow do I get help?\n\n * Contact Open eBooks using this contact request form.\n * Email Open eBooks directly at info@openebooks.org\n * For Clever issues, see here: How do I contact Clever Support?\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCLEVER RESOURCES:\n\n\n\n * District set up kit\n * Teacher roll out guide\n * Parent hand out (steps for downloading the application, in English and Spanish)\n\n\n\n\nOPEN EBOOK RESOURCES:\n\n\n\n * Open eBooks FAQ\n * Educator Resources\n * About Open eBooks’ partners"

If your district has't been set up with Clever, you can get started by going to\n   this link: https://clever.com/signup\n * If your district is already on Clever, you can add GradeCam by following these instructions:\n   * Log into your Clever Dashboard and select: Applications > Add applications from the left navigation.\n   * Search for GradeCam\n   * You'll then be brought to a page where you can request the application. When requesting an application, select whether or not\n     your district has already purchased the application. When you click \"Haven't Purchased\" for applications that have free\n     trials, you'll receive a prompt asking if you'd like to try a free trial.\n   * You'll also be asked if you'd like to request a custom Launch Date. The Launch Date is the first day users can access the app\n     through Clever.\n   * Once you've made your selections, click Request!\n * GradeCam supports rostering and single sign-on (SSO) for teacher users. Upon first SSO login through Clever, GradeCam will\n   prompt teachers to either enter existing GradeCam login credentials or create new ones, allowing SSO ongoing. (SSO through\n   Clever isn't required by GradeCam as teachers can log in directly at app.gradecam.com.)\n * Once districts have shared data with GradeCam, the GradeCam team will set up the initial sync - they’ll reach out to let you\n   know when that’s finished!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nGradeCam requires Term Name for sections, and they would prefer to have Term Start and Term End dates as well. Depending on your\nSIS, setting this up can be a little tricky, so here are some general guidelines:\n\n\n\nCLEVER-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS:\n\nFor our Aeries, Infinite Campus API, PowerSchool, Illuminate, Skyward API and Skyward Auto Syncs, Clever pulls these fields by\ndefault. If the default field Clever is using isn’t the best for your district, you can set up a custom mapping by following the\ninstructions in this Help Center article: How do I customize my auto-sync?\n \n\nIf you’re having trouble setting up the custom mapping, please reach out to Clever Support!\n \n\nFor our Infinite Campus Auto Sync, mapping the term dates from the SIS can pull dates for the full year, which doesn't allow the\nclasses to show correctly in GradeCam. For Infinite Campus Auto Sync districts, please make sure that each term shows the correct\ndates. Ex: a Q1 term may have a start date of 8/1/2021 and an end date of 10/15/2021 but it should NOT have a start date of\n8/1/2021 and an end date of 7/1/2022 (full year). Please check your data browser to see if dates have synced correctly and reach\nout to Clever Support with questions.\n\n\n\nSIS-MANAGED AUTO SYNCS:\n\nPlease reach out to your SIS vendor and let them know that you'd like to have Term Name, Term Start, and Term End dates added to\nyour sync.\n\nA full list of Clever-managed and SIS-managed auto syncs can be found here: Which SISs support an auto sync?\n\n\n\nSFTP SYNCS:\n\nYour district will need to add the Term_name, Term_start, and Term_end fields to your Sections CSV file. You can use this Help\nCenter article to help you format your file: SFTP: How do I format my CSV files?\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQS\n\n\nWHY AM I GETTING A “DATA WARNING” OR A “DATA REQUIREMENT” ERROR?\n\n * A data requirement error occurs when the record is incompatible with GradeCam's integration with Clever, and the user or\n   section will not appear in the application. Data Requirements must be resolved for users or sections to be successfully\n   processed by the application.\n * A data warning error occurs when the user or section has a compatibility issue with the application that may result in a\n   degraded app experience. We recommend addressing these issues or contacting the application directly to determine the impact of\n   a particular Data Warning.\n * For an in-depth look into any existing GradeCam data warnings or errors, please refer to the Data Quality page of the Clever\n   dashboard.\n\n\n\nWHY IS A TEACHER MISSING FROM GRADECAM?\n\n * Make sure that the teacher has sections in Clever - GradeCam won't import teachers without section assignments. You can check\n   this by searching for the teacher in the data browser.\n * GradeCam only supports primary teachers. If a section has co-teachers, they won't be synced to GradeCam.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSUPPORT CONTACTS\n\n * Clever Support\n * GradeCam Support"

The simplest way to do so is to select “Share All Data” in Clever.\nIf you plan to share specific schools, you can find more info about “Share by Rules” here. You can create a sharing rule by going\nto the Sharing Permissions page for BrainPOP Suite. To do this, log in to your Clever account and click the icon for BrainPOP\nSuite in the sidebar. From the Data Sharing tab, click Share All Data.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nCheck the Data Quality tab in your Clever dashboard to see whether you’re meeting the required data fields. BrainPOP requires the\nfollowing data fields be sent:\n\n * Student: name, school, sis_id, district, schools, graduation_year, credentials\n * Teacher: district, name, school, schools, sis_id, credentials, email, state_id, teacher_number, title\n * School Admin: district, name, schools, staff_id, email, credentials, title, roles\n * District admin: district, name.first, name.last, email, title\n\n \n\nIMPORTANT \nBe sure to keep the BrainPOP Suite app connected, as this powers rostering for all BrainPOP applications.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nApostrophes\nPlease keep in mind that if you're syncing any users whose names have apostrophes, they must be the vertical type (') instead of a\ncurled version. If it's curled, it will trigger a data error and filter out the user!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWhy am I getting a “data warning” or a “data error”?\n\n * A data error occurs when the record is incompatible with BrainPOP’s integration with Clever, and the user or section will not\n   appear in the application. Data Errors must be resolved for users or sections to be successfully processed by the application.\n   Contact Clever Support if you have questions about resolving your data error.\n * A data warning occurs when the user or section has a compatibility issue with the application that may result in a degraded app\n   experience. We recommend addressing these issues or contacting the application directly to determine the impact of a particular\n   Data Warning.\n    \n\nWhy is a student or teacher missing from BrainPOP?\n * Please check to see if this user meets the following requirements before reaching out to BrainPOP:\n   * In your SIS data\n   * In your Clever data\n   * Is shared with BrainPOP in your data-sharing permissions\n\n\nCan multiple teachers/staff be assigned to the same course/section?\n * BrainPOP can support multiple teachers or staff assigned to the same course/section.\n\n\nCan multiple teachers/staff be assigned to the same course/section?\n * BrainPOP can support multiple teachers or staff assigned to the same course/section.\n\n\nWhy do I have to approve invites to multiple applications?\n * BrainPOP has multiple student- and teacher-facing SSO applications in Clever (BrainPOP, BrainPOP Jr, BrainPOP ELL), all of\n   which roster via the BrainPOP Rostering application. \n * To use any BrainPOP product via Clever, please ensure that you’ve connected ‘BrainPOP Suite’ and the SSO application for any of\n   the BrainPOP products your district has purchased. All schools with a subscription to any BrainPOP product should be shared\n   with the BrainPOP Suite app. \n\n\nWhy did I get an email inviting me to connect with BrainPOP in Clever?\n * If you received an invitation to connect to BrainPOP, BrainPOP Jr., or BrainPOP ELL, that means schools within your district\n   have a subscription to a BrainPOP product. BrainPOP is excited to offer your district SSO and automated rostering via Clever\n   starting this school year at no cost to you. \n * The invitation from the BrainPOP team should include suggested sharing rules with the right schools listed. If you still have\n   questions about which of your schools have subscriptions to a BrainPOP product or would like to speak with the BrainPOP team\n   directly, please reach out to onboarding@brainpop.com.\n\n  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSUPPORT CONTACTS\n\n\nBRAINPOP  \n\nHelp.brainpop.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n \nContact BrainPOP with issues that relate to:\n\n * An error message within any BrainPOP URL\n\n \nClever\nSupport.clever.com (click the chat icon in the corner of the screen)\n\nContact Clever with issues that relate to:\n\n * Data within Clever, or data coming from Clever."

Common Troubleshooting Help\n\n \n\nPlease note: We are in the process of updating this article, and some information may be out-of-date. We apologize for any\ninconvenience and are working to resolve this as quickly as possible. \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever has multiple different application types which determine how you should set up your applications. This article describes\nhow to set up various different HMH SAML applications.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHMH SAML APPLICATIONS\n\nThe following directions are for configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) for these HMH products:  \n\n * HMH ThinkCentral\n * HMH MyHRW  \n * HMH Ed Learning Platform  \n * HMH SAML\n * Heinemann Flight SSO\n\n  These are the directions that should be used if your HMH application displays the status: Incomplete SAML Setup\n\n\n\nPlease note:  These steps will need to be followed for each of your HMH applications. If you're looking to set up rostering for\nthese products, you'll also need to follow the directions here.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP\n\n1. In the Clever Dashboard, navigate to Applications > Add Apps. Search for the desired application and select Request\napplication. It is optional to set your sharing at this point.\n\n\n\n2. On the application’s page, click Settings. Under SAML Details, copy the Metadata URL\n \n\n\n\n\n3. In a new browser tab, log in to your HMH Admin account. From the left-hand navigation, select Roster. Under Roster information,\nclick on Roster Actions and select Manage SSO Configuration.\n\n\n\n\n4. Click Add SAML\n\n\n\n\n5. Paste the Metadata URL from Step 2 and give the SSO Configuration a name (e.g. “Clever”). Click Add and wait for HMH to\ncomplete the setup (~10 seconds)\n\n\n\n\n6. Copy the SSO endpoint for the application you are setting up in Clever.\n\nClever App\n\nHMH SSO Endpoint\n\n HMH ThinkCentralThinkCentral (grades PK-8) SSO Endpoint  HMH myHRWHolt McDoughal Online (Grades 6-12) SSO Endpoint HMH Ed\nLearning Platform HMH Ed SSO Endpoint  HMH SAMStudent Achievement Manager (SAM) Heinemann Flight Flight \n\n \n\n\n\n\n7. Return to the browser tab containing the Clever Dashboard. On the application’s settings  tab, find the section titled SAML\nDetails and select Edit.\n\n\n\n\n8. Paste the SSO endpoint from Step 6 into the textbox titled SSO Endpoint\n\n\n\n \n\n Please note: For Heinemann Flight, the textbox for the SSO Endpoint is titled \"Login URL.\" For this application, please put the\nSSO Endpoint from Step 6 in the Login URL box:\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n9. Return to the HMH Admin dashboard. Copy the HMH Metadata URL and enter it in your SAML app settings. Click Parse Metadata,\nwhich will automatically populate the Asset URL and Encryption Certificate, and then Confirm.\n\n\n\n\n10. Your SAML connection is pre-configured with a set of default attributes that should work for most SSO configurations with HMH.\nIf necessary, you can change the mappings here at any time. Otherwise, click Confirm. \n \n\n\n\n\n11.  If you have not already, set your sharing permissions and verify the configuration with a test user!\n\nIf you need to configure any other HMH apps, you can do so by copying the relevant SSO Endpoint from HMH, and re-using the same\nHMH Metadata URL from the Clever app you just configured.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCOMMON TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS\n\nBelow are some common pitfalls in setting up HMH SAML Connections through Clever. Please use these if you are running into issues:\n * Incorrect SAML configuration\n   * If a user sees this screen after launching an HMH SAML application:\n\n\n\nThe application is most likely set up with the SAML information for another Clever application (possibly one the district had been\nconnected to previously). The resolution for this issue is to delete the SAML connection in the HMH admin dashboard and create a\nnew one with the metadata link from the application. \n * Encryption Certificate Issues\n   * Sometimes, the Encryption Certificate is pasted into the SAML Details with extra spaces. This will lead to an “Uh oh! Unknown\n     error occurred” message for the user. To resolve this issue, check for any spaces in the Encryption Certificate field (a\n     valid certificate will not have any spaces)."

Who to contact for support\n\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article is a guide to help connect the ANet learning application.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNEW CLEVER DISTRICTS\n\n 1. If your district has not been set up with Clever, you can get started by going to this link: https://clever.com/signup or\n    accept your invite to set up with Clever by clicking the ‘Set up with Clever’ link in your email invitation from ANet.\n 2. Set your password and log in to the Clever Dashboard (your username is your email address).\n 3. Connect your student information system (SIS) data to Clever by going to the Sync page from the left-hand side of your Clever\n    Dashboard and choosing your SIS from the dropdown menu.\n     \n    The instructions to connect your SIS data will appear once you’ve selected your SIS and will vary depending on your sync type.\n    Check out this article for more information: Which sync option should I choose? \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEXISTING CLEVER DISTRICTS\n\nIf your district already uses Clever, connecting to ANet can take only a few clicks! These are the steps you can expect:\n\n * Accept ANet’s invite to connect or request to connect with ANet.\n * Accept ANet's sharing suggestions or share the applicable roster data.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINITIAL SETUP PROCESS\n\nHere are your steps to get started:\n\n1. Connect with the ANet application by either accepting our invite or requesting our application.\n\n2. Share your data with ANet.\n\nNow it’s time to set your sharing permissions for the ANet application. If you accepted our “recommended sharing” you’re probably\nalready done or nearly there! If you choose to decline ANet’s “recommended sharing” read this article to learn more about setting\nsharing permissions. More information about sharing permissions can be found below. Please note, you can always update data\nsharing at any time!\n\n3.Review your data\n\nReview your ANet overview page to see what data you’ve approved to share. For an even deeper look, review the data in the Data\nbrowser or simply search for a record in the “Search” box, located on the top of your dashboard screen.\n\nIf you need to make any updates, use the “Edit sharing” link on ANet Overview. \n\n4. Check your launch date\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed the right data is being shared, make sure that students can start logging into ANet at the right time by\nchecking your launch date.\n \n\nYour “launch date” is the day that the ANet icon (pictured below) will appear in the Clever Portal for students to login. If you\nneed the launch date updated, please request that action from ANet Support. For more on launch dates, see this article.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING RULES\n\nANet recommends you share your data by rules. This ensures Clever is only sharing the data that ANet needs, and additional data\nisn’t being shared unnecessarily. If you are accepting ANet’s invitation to connect, we will already have suggested sharing rules\nset up through the invitation. Accepting ANet’s invitation is the recommended process. If you are requesting to sync with ANet,\nyou will need to set up your own sharing rules. Read this article to learn more about how to Share by Rules or follow the guidance\nbelow:\n\nThere are a number of 'Fields' districts can use to either include or exclude data with the application sharing rules. The fields\navailable are dependent on the type of sharing rule you selected (e.g. share by teacher, share by section, share by student)\n \n\n * The modifiers available are:\n   * equals any of\n   * does not equal any of\n   * contains text\n   * does not contain text\n   * starts with text\n\nYou should only share the classes that will be administering ANet assessments (subjects and grade levels). This is typically\nlimited to only classes that are labeled ELA and/or Math in your SIS, and grades 2 through 12.\n\n\n\nIf your special education or gifted classes are listed as something other than ELA and/or Math, and are administering ANet\nassessments, you will want to share these classes as well.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTEACHER EMAILS\n\nPlease note, ANet cannot process rostering information for classes whose teacher’s do not have school email addresses in Clever.\nPlease confirm all teachers have unique school emails when sharing your rostering information with ANet.\n\nIf you have any teachers without email addresses, these will appear in your data warnings, illustrated below.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO SET UP SINGLE SIGN-ON\n\nStudents can use Clever SSO to log into their ANet application. To set up student SSO, please view this resource. We recommend\ntesting student SSO prior to their ANet administration to limit unforeseen challenges. At this time the ANet application does not\nsupport Clever SSO for teachers.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\nCREATING CUSTOM SECTIONS\n\nClever Custom Sections allow district administrators to create and manage sections manually within the Clever Dashboard. Once\ncustom sections are created in Clever, administrators can share them with ANet through the Clever sharing permissions interface.\nYou can read more about Clever custom sections here.\n \n\nA few examples for when you’d want to create Custom Sections are:\n \n\n * <High School Only> One class period contains multiple courses. ANet can only assign one course per period, so if students take\n   different courses in the same class, you will need to create Clever Custom Sections for each course within the period\n * If you want to view your data differently than is currently coming through Clever (e.g. view data by homeroom as opposed to ELA\n   and/or Math class)\n * If there are students who do not need access to ANet products (assessments or quiz tool).\n\n\n\nTERM CHANGES\n\nIn your SIS, some sections may be assigned to a specific term. Students in a given section will have an active enrollment in\nClever during the dates of that term. When a term ends, students in those sections no longer have an active enrollment. When this\noccurs, a student may not have access to ANet through Clever for 1-2 business days while the ANet team shifts the student from\ntheir old section to their new section.  Please reach out to ANet Support in advance to coordinate logistics.\n \n\nThis resource provides additional information about terms.  If you have any questions or concerns about the ability for a student\nto view their ANet interim during a term rollover, please contact ANet Support so we can strategize with your district.\n \n\n\nMAINTAINING STUDENT ROSTERING INFORMATION\n\nThroughout the year, ANet will automatically receive any student or enrollment changes that are made in your SIS through Clever.\nPlease ensure that your Student Information System is up-to-date so students are properly enrolled at the time of their\nadministration. You should expect these changes to be reflected in ANet within 48 hours of the update in your Student Information\nSystem. If you have questions about maintaining your student roster, reach out to ANet Support.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHO TO CONTACT FOR SUPPORT\n\n * If the issue is related to data within Clever or data coming from Clever, please contact Clever Support.\n * If the issue is related to functionality within ANet, such as assessment availability, please contact ANet Support.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Support Contacts\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nUse this guide to help connect to Imagine Learning applications.\n\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\n * Make sure your district is set up with Clever! If your district has not been set up with Clever, you can get started by going\n   to this link: https://clever.com/signup or by accepting your invitation from Imagine Learning. For more information on setting\n   up Clever for the first time, please see this guide.\n\nImportant: Imagine Learning has several apps on Clever. Please ensure you connect to the correct application(s) your district has\npurchased. \n \n\nApplication Name\n\nIcon\n\nDescription\n\nImagine MathImagine Math is a research-based, adaptive, online supplemental math solution suite for students in Pre-K through\nGeometry. Through personalized learning paths driven by the Quantile® Framework, Imagine Math engages students with motivational\ncontests and charitable donations, intentionally scaffolds learning for grade-level success, and provides on-demand access to\nlive, certified math teachers when students need it most.Imagine Math FactsImagine Math Facts teaches fluency in addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division to elementary and middle school students through game-like activities with built-in\nrewards in an immersive 3-D world—helping each student gain math automaticity.Imagine Language & LiteracyImagine Language &\nLiteracy teaches foundational reading, reading comprehension, and language development skills to Pre-K to Grade 6 students through\nengaging digital activities, personalized learning paths, and offline resources.Imagine EspañolImagine Español teaches Spanish\nfoundational reading, reading comprehension, and language development skills to Spanish-speaking students in Pre-K to Grade 2\nthrough engaging digital activities and offline resources.Imagine ReadingImagine Reading teaches reading comprehension, academic\ndiscourse, and information synthesis skills to Grade 3 to 8 students through media-rich text sets (for online close reading),\nteacher-mediated discussion materials, and offline group project guidelines.Imagine LecturaImagine Lectura builds strong readers,\ncritical thinkers, and confident biliterate communicators through the study of high-quality, authentic Spanish language text sets\nwith students in grades 3-5.Galileo K-12Galileo is a Reading/ELA benchmark assessment that assesses students 3 times per year to\nappropriately place them on their individual instructional path. This comprehensive suite offers real-time reporting tools to\nreliably track student growth and provide the data to support effective teaching and learning, resulting in high student\nachievement against college and career readiness standards.\n\n \n\n \n\n * If your district is already on Clever, you can connect Imagine Learning’s applications by accepting your invite OR following\n   these instructions:\n   * Log into your Clever Dashboard and select: Applications > Add Applications from the left navigation.\n   * Search for Imagine Learning\n   * You will then be brought to a page where you can authorize your Imagine Learning request. As Clever SSO and rostering for\n     Imagine Learning is provided at no cost to the district, you can mark that it has already been purchased for the district.\n   * You will also be asked if you would like to request a custom Launch Date. The Launch Date is the first day users can see the\n     Imagine Learning icons in their Clever portal. Product access may or may not be available on this day.\n   * Once you have made your selections, click Request!\n\nOnce you have shared data with Imagine Learning, the Imagine Learning team will set up the initial sync and will reach out to you\nto discuss communicating with teachers.\n \n\n \n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING\n\nBefore sharing:\n \n\n * Make sure to match product applications with purchased license counts. \n * Ensure that students and teachers are in their correct grade levels and that classes are updated for the current school year in\n   your Student Information System (SIS).\n\nImagine Learning recommends that you “Share by Rules” in Clever (you can find more info about “Share by Rules” here). Create a\nsharing rule by following these steps:\n\n \n\n 1. Access the Sharing Permissions page for Imagine Learning. To do this, log in to your Clever account and click the icon for\n    Imagine Learning in the sidebar. From the 'Data Sharing' tab, click Share by Rules.\n 2. Configure your sharing rules by limiting sharing to only the schools, and students that should be synced, and by only sharing\n    sections with the appropriate subject.\n\n * For Literacy products we recommend “Homeroom/Advisory” or “English/Language Arts”.\n * For Math products we recommend “Homeroom/Advisory” or “Math”.\n\nImportant: To avoid delays in product access, Imagine Learning must receive your updated and completed sharing rules at least 7\nbusiness days prior to your target launch date.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nCheck the Data Quality tab in your Clever dashboard to see whether you’re meeting the required data fields. Imagine Learning\nrequires the following data fields be sent:\n\nStudent:\n\n * name\n * district\n * school\n * sis_id and/or student_number\n * credentials\n * grade\n\n\nTeacher/School Admin/District admin:\n\n * name\n * district\n * school(s)\n * email\n\n\n*A few things to keep in mind for Math Products: \n\n * In order for teachers to see students, and for student accounts to function properly, students must be assigned to a classroom.\n * Each educator should only be shared as a teacher or staff or a district admin. Accounts shared in more than one role may have\n   the wrong role assigned in-product. \n * Teachers can only be assigned to one school.\n * Students should only be shared with one math class, where possible.  \n * Co-teachers are not supported in sections.\n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQS\n\nWhy am I getting a “data warning” or a “data error”?\n\n * A data error occurs when the record is incompatible with Imagine Learning’s integration with Clever, and the user or section\n   will not appear in the application.

Users at multiple school sites\n6. Co-teachers\n7. Duplicate sections\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFounded in 2002, Raptor has partnered with over 52,000 schools globally, including over 5,000 K-12 U.S. school districts, to\nprovide integrated visitor, volunteer, emergency management, safeguarding, and early intervention software and services that cover\nthe full spectrum of school and student safety.\n\nBy adding Raptor Technologies to your district’s Clever account, you're securely and automatically sending your most up-to-date\nroster data from your SIS to Raptor.\n\nIn this article, we’ll go over some best practices to consider when connecting with Raptor through Clever. Since each district’s\nsync setup is different, please reach out to Clever Support with any questions or concerns.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING STAFF\n\nFor Raptor Technologies and in general, you will want to have all of your staff in Clever, including non-teaching and non-admin\nstaff. Please see Clever Roles: Staff - How to add to Clever for instructions. We typically recommend the “uploading staff via\nCSV” method, but please reach out to Clever Support if this does not work for your district’s setup.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSHARING CONSIDERATIONS\n\nFor Raptor Technologies, we recommend sharing all district data with the app. Please see Sharing Permissions: Overview and the\nShare by District option.\n\nOne common concern is that districts want to make sure their staff members, especially non-teaching and non-admin staff, don't\nhave access to some/all of the district’s other applications. You can avoid oversharing staff with your other applications by\nsetting your other apps to Share by Rules and making sure only to include the appropriate staff users.\n\nIf there are staff members you only want to share with Raptor, and none of your other applications, we recommend giving them a\ntitle such as “Raptor Only” when creating your Staff.csv file. This way, they will be easy to exclude from your other apps’\nsharing rules.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONTACTS\n\nContacts are important to include in your sync with Raptor, since parents/guardians will need to be notified if there is an\nemergency. To make sure your student contacts are syncing from your SIS to Clever, please visit your Data browser and check the\nContacts tab.\n\nContacts are automatically shared with Raptor. You can make sure they are shared by visiting Raptor’s Settings page within your\nClever Dashboard.\n\nIf you're concerned about oversharing contacts with your other applications, you can go into the settings for your other apps and\nmake sure that contacts are not shared if not appropriate. See For District Admins: Apps - Field Access for how to do this. If\nyou’re unsure about this, please reach out to Clever Support for assistance.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSERS AT MULTIPLE SCHOOL SITES\n\nRaptor prefers that all users are associated with one school site only. If possible, you can edit your Staff.csv file to ensure\nstaff are each associated with only one school site.\n\nIf needed, Raptor can support users at multiple schools, with the caveat that staff assigned to multiple buildings will most\nlikely impact the reporting of emergency accountability at schools that they are not at during the time of the emergency. For\nexample, if a staff person is at School B today but School A has an emergency, they will be seen as \"missing\" during School A’s\nemergency because they are physically at School B. The same would apply to students assigned to multiple sites.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCO-TEACHERS\n\nRaptor doesn't currently support syncing co-teachers/secondary teachers from Clever. The primary teacher will sync to Raptor for\neach section.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDUPLICATE SECTIONS\n\nRaptor doesn't sync duplicate sections. For any two sections that have the same teacher and the same section name, the following\nis true:\n\n * If the section name and the student list are identical on both rosters, then all shared students on both rosters do not sync.\n * If the section name is the same but the student list is different on the two sections, Raptor will combine them into one larger\n   section.\n\nTo avoid this, we recommend making sure that teachers have unique section names for each of their sections. It is not an issue if\ntwo different teachers have sections with the same names since Raptor will recognize they're different sections belonging to\ndifferent teachers."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Getting Started\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article is a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up Google Classroom roster import via Clever.\n \n\n *  For an overview of the capabilities of Google Classroom roster import, please see this article.\n * For detailed requirements and troubleshooting, please see this article.\n\nGoogle Classroom roster import helps you securely sync rosters from any SIS and automatically create and update courses in Google\nClassroom. It is available as an app in the Clever app gallery for any US of Canadian district using Google Workspace for\nEducation Plus for staff and students. Your district’s Google Workspace Super Administrator will need to help set up Google\nClassroom roster import.\n\n \n\n\nIf you'd like step-by-step directions, teacher training resources, and more, check out our Quick Start Guide on Google Classroom\nroster import in Clever Academy!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nOnce you've had the Google Classroom roster import app added to your Clever Dashboard, here’s how to proceed. Please note that\napproval of your request to connect with the app is automated, and can take around 24 hours to be approved, so please factor this\ninto your timeline for getting set up!\n\n To begin, access the setup wizard from the Google Classroom roster import app overview page:\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Review details and FAQs about Clever’s Google Classroom roster import integration.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Preview your data. You need student and teacher email addresses in Clever in order to utilize this integration. If email\naddresses are not stored in your SIS, you will need to manually upload them via csv file.\n\n\n\nGoogle Classroom roster import uses the following fields to create and roster courses in Google Classroom:\n * students: email, Clever section id\n * teachers: email, Clever section id\n * sections: name, period, sis id, Clever section id\n * optional: additional fields used in naming the course, see Step 4 for more information\n\n\nStep 3: Sign in to connect your Google account. Please note that a Google Workspace Super Administrator must complete this\nsetup. The Super Admin whose token is being used needs to have an EduPlus license assigned.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Configure course names. By default, course names and periods in Google Classroom are set by your section name and period\nin Clever. If you think the default name would be unclear to teachers, you can modify the naming convention using our course\nnaming tool. This allows you to configure how courses should be named in Google Classroom by using the fields available in\nClever. \n\n\n\n\n\nAny fields selected must be populated with data or it will result in an error. In the example below, a school district chose\nCourse Number, which isn't a required field in Clever. Since this isn't required, the warning box will appear, and if there is an\nerror with any field, it will show in the preview on the right. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Enable ‘Clever Roster Import’ in the Google Admin console and confirm this step is complete within your Clever dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Set your sharing permissions to indicate which users should be connected to Google Classroom roster import. You can roster\nyour entire district, select schools, or even specific users. Please see more about Clever sharing permissions here.\n\nMany districts prefer to share only the current term's sections to avoid confusion for their teachers. \nSee the course rollover article for more information.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Schedule your access dates for teachers and students. Teachers will see courses when the teacher access date arrives,\nallowing them to prepare for the upcoming semester. Students will be added to courses on the student access date, allowing them to\nsee the courses teachers have accepted. Data will sync for each user type at 12:30 AM PST/3:30 am EST on the access date input in\nthe application’s settings.\n\n\n\nIf you ever need to go back and modify your configurations, including your first sync date, in the setup wizard, you can go back\nto it by clicking on this link on the overview page: \n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Finished! Google Classroom courses will be created based on your Clever data.\n\nWhen teachers log into Google Classroom, they’ll have the option to approve or reject the Clever-created courses. Teachers will\nneed to 'accept' the courses in order to have them syncing automatically!\n\n \n\n * For detailed requirements and troubleshooting, please see this article.\n * If you need further assistance with the setup, please reach out to Clever Support here\n * If you’re interested in learning more about the teacher experience or sharing information with your district’s teachers, please\n   see this Help Center article.\n * For an overview of the capabilities of the Google Classroom roster import application, please see this article.\n * For an overview of handling summer or semester rollover, including how to communicate with teachers, see this article."

Setting up co-teachers in Newsela\n6. Users with old Newsela accounts\n7. FAQs\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article runs through key steps when connecting with Newsela, including any unique aspects to ensure your users are set up for\nsuccess!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\n 1. Make sure your district is set up with Clever! If your district has not been set up with Clever, you can get started by going\n    to this link: https://clever.com/signup\n 2. If your district is already on Clever, you can add Newsela by following these instructions:\n    * Log into your Clever Dashboard and select: Applications > Add Applications from the left navigation.\n    * Search for Newsela.\n    * You will also be asked if you would like to request a custom Launch Date. The Launch Date is the first day users can access\n      the application through Clever.\n    * Once you have made your selections, click Request!\n 3. Once you have made your request, it will be sent to the Newsela team for approval. This process usually takes one business\n    day but may take as long as a week during peak periods.\n 4. Once the request is accepted, Newsela recommends logging in a few users to confirm that they can sign in and import classes.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING RULES\n\nNewsela recommends sharing data by school. You can share data for all your schools - including schools that may not have Newsela\nPRO licenses yet. Any users not covered by a Newsela PRO license who log in with Clever will be taken to Newsela's free product.\n\n For more information on sharing data with applications, please see: How do I set my sharing permissions for applications?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP NEWSELA FOR SCHOOL AND DISTRICT LEADERS\n\nNewsela's Binder feature provides school and district leaders with the ability to aggregate student performance data. School and\ndistrict leaders will need to be set up in Clever and log into Newsela with Clever to ensure Binder access.\n\n * Any administrators who need district-wide binder access should be added to Clever in the District Curriculum Lead or District\n   Administrator role.\n * Any school administrators who need school level binder access should be added to Clever in the Staff role.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP CO-TEACHERS IN NEWSELA\n\nNewsela supports co-teachers and will import co-teachers from Clever. If you are using the Clever integration, Newsela co-teachers\nhave to be set up in Clever by a system administrator and cannot be set up by individual teachers in Newsela.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUSERS WITH OLD NEWSELA ACCOUNTS\n\nMany teachers create free Newsela accounts before their district purchases Newsela and are concerned about retaining data\nassociated with their free accounts.\n\n\nNewsela automatically merges user accounts with matching email addresses. If a teacher sets up a free Newsela account with their\ndistrict email address, the system will recognize and merge their account the first time they log in to Newsela with Clever using\nthat email address. As long as the email addresses match in all systems, users can easily change authentication methods. Users who\nlog in using accounts associated with different email addresses will create duplicate accounts.\n\n\nNewsela's support team can merge accounts if users provide both email addresses. Teachers who need accounts merged should contact\nNewsela's support team at https://support.newsela.com/hc/en-us\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQS\n\n\nWHY AM I GETTING A \"DATA WARNING\" OR A \"DATA REQUIREMENT\" ERROR?\n\nA data requirement error occurs when the record is incompatible with Newsela's integration with Clever. In this case, the user or\nsection will not appear in the application. Data requirements must be resolved for users or sections to be successfully processed\nby the application.\n\n\nA data warning error occurs when the user or section has a data compatibility issue with the application that may result in a\ndegraded experience within the application. We recommend addressing these issues or contacting the application directly to\ndetermine the impact of a particular data warning.\n \n\n For more information on data compatibility, please see: What are data warnings and data errors?\n\n\n\nWHY IS MY STUDENT OR TEACHER MISSING FROM NEWSELA?\n\nPlease check to see if this user meets the following requirements before reaching out to Newsela:\n\n * Student or teacher is present in your SIS data\n * Student or teacher is present in our Clever data and shared with Newsela\n\nIf the user is missing from your Clever data, but in your SIS, please contact Clever Support.\n\n\n\nWHY ARE CLASSES MISSING FROM CLEVER?\n\nNewsela only imports current classes from Clever. If a teacher attempts to sync a Clever class before the term start date, the\nclass will not import.\n\n\nTeachers might be missing classes because the classes have either not been imported or because they've been archived. Teachers can\nresolve this by following these steps:\n\n 1. In Newsela, click on the Archived Classes tab.\n 2. Select \"Restore\" to reactivate the missing classes. If there are no classes in the page, skip to the next step.\n 3. Navigate back to the Classes tab.\n 4. Click \"Sync with Clever\"\n\nIf the class is missing from your Clever data, but in your SIS, please contact Clever Support.\n\n\n\nWHO SHOULD I ASK FOR HELP WITH THIS ISSUE?\n\nIf the issue is related to data within Clever or data coming from Clever, please contact Clever Support.\n\n\nIf the issue is related to functionality within Newsela, please contact Newsela Support."

Where can I go for support?\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMcGraw Hill and Clever’s expanded partnership makes it easier than ever before for students to access digital learning tools. The\nintegration supports account provisioning and access to any programs hosted on the ConnectED or Open Learning Platform. This guide\ncontains important information about the setup process including integration requirements. \n \n\nIMPORTANT: Please read before proceeding with the setup process\n\nCommunication: Setting up a Clever integration requires a conversation with McGraw Hill Digital Integration Services. Make sure to\nschedule a project call with McGraw Hill.\n\nSwitching rostering methods:  If you’re moving to Clever from self-registered accounts, please be ready to work with McGraw Hill\non a user clean-up process to delete old data (students & possibly teachers).\n\nIf you’re switching from a different method, McGraw Hill may have to re-match your historic customer data with your shared Clever\ndata to retain historical data.\n\nData readiness: Your district should be sending Clever term and course data. McGraw Hill requires term data in order to create\ncourses, classes, users, etc. Not having this will prevent your district from proceeding. Stable course data will allow your\ndistrict to more easily assign digital content (e.g. so classes receive the correct textbooks) prior to launch.\n\nInteroperability: If you plan on having users access McGraw Hill from platforms outside of Clever (e.g. Canvas), please be\nprepared to send Clever the same unique user ID you use to identify those users on other platforms (e.g., SIS ID) in your SIS\nsync.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\n1. Make sure your district is set up with Clever. If your district does not yet have a Clever account, you can get started by\nnavigating to https://clever.com/signup. \n \n2. If your district is already on Clever, you can add McGraw Hill by following these steps:\n * Log into your Clever Dashboard and select Applications > Add Applications from the left navigation.\n * Search for McGraw Hill\n * When you request a connection with the application, you will also be asked if you would like to request a custom Launch Date.\n   The Launch Date is the first day users can access the application through Clever.\n * Once you have made your selections, click Request.\n\n3. These requests will create a ticket with the McGraw Hill Digital Integration Services team, who will schedule an implementation\ncall with you. The timing of these requests will be based on McGraw Hill’s current volume and having a conversation with McGraw\nHill to develop your project plan.\n * McGraw Hill integration services must be configured at the Clever district/account level and include all users of your McGraw\n   Hill K-12 content currently hosted on our ConnectED and Open Learning platforms. McGraw Hill Digital Integration Services may\n   discuss the details of your full Clever integration on a scheduled implementation call. \n\n4. FYI: If you are already discussing this integration with your McGraw Hill representative, you may receive an invitation to\nconnect directly in your Clever Dashboard. If so, please check your Clever Dashboard to accept your app invite. \n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING RULES \n\nMcGraw Hill recommends sharing only the classes and users at the school sites that will be using the program. This can include\ngrades K-12 and subjects ranging from english/language arts, math, science, social studies, language, interventions/online\nlearning, science, and arts and music. Please note: Data sharing permissions will vary according to your district’s purchasing\nagreement.\n\nYou can find more information about setting up sharing rules in this guide. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDATA REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe following fields must be successfully synced to Clever in order for your data to successfully sync with McGraw Hill:\n\n * Term names, start dates, and end dates\n * Course names \n * Teacher, student, and staff usernames\n * Teacher email addresses \n * Student email (recommended but not required)\n\nPlease note that user IDs (sis_ids) must be globally unique across your district. In other words, a teacher and a student cannot\nhave the same sis_id in Clever.\n\nYou can check if your data meets the requirements by navigating to the McGraw Hill > Data Quality tab in your Clever Dashboard. \n\nIn Clever, data quality issues will be represented as “data warnings” or “data errors”. For more information on resolving data\nquality issues, please review this article. \n \n\nIMPORTANT: The data requirements outlined above are hard requirements for setting up rostering and SSO successfully with Clever\nand McGraw Hill. Failure to fulfill these requirements means McGraw Hill will not be able to create courses, classes, and users\nfor your district. If you are not sending some of these required fields to Clever or are experiencing issues with data quality\nissues, please work with Clever Support to troubleshoot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMANAGING LICENSES & ASSIGNING CONTENT\n\nOnce you have resolved all of the data quality issues, please work with the McGraw Hill Digital Integration Services team to\nensure your district’s licenses and McGraw Hill content have been properly assigned in their rostering platform, Access Manager.\nFor more information on how to assign your content in McGraw Hill, please see their documentation.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHERE CAN I GO FOR SUPPORT?\n\nClever Support:\n\n * For help troubleshooting rosters, SIS Clever syncs, or login settings, check out our Help Center where you can open a ticket\n   with Clever Support.\n\nMcGraw Hill Digital Technical Support:\n\n * For help with McGraw Hill platforms, please contact integrationsupport@mheducation.com."

Support Contacts\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article contains information to help your school district get set up with Clever and Summit Learning.\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\n * Make sure your district is set up with Clever! If your district has not been set up with Clever, you can get started by going\n   to this link: https://clever.com/signup\n * If your district is already on Clever, you can add Summit Learning by following these instructions:\n   * Log into your Clever Dashboard and select: Applications > Add Applications from the left navigation.\n   * Search for Summit Learning\n   * You will then be brought to a page where you can authorize requesting the applications. When requesting Summit Learning,\n     select that you have already purchased the application (Summit Learning is free, so you don't need to make a purchase).\n   * You will also be asked if you would like to request a custom Launch Date. The Launch Date is the first day users can access\n     the app through Clever.\n   * Once you have made your selections, click Request!\n   * Please note that you will need to have Google or O365 for Education schoolwide to access Summit\n   * You will need to let Summit know that you’re ready to sync through Clever- data won’t automatically sync to Summit platform.\n     Contact Summit Support or your Summit representative to get started!\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING RULES\n\nSummit recommends that you create a custom section sharing rule for your district. The simplest way to do so, is to “Share by\nRules” in Clever. You can create a sharing rule by following these steps:\n\n 1. Access the Sharing Permissions page for Summit Learning. To do this, log in to your Clever account and click the icon for the\n    name of the app in the sidebar. From the 'Data Sharing' tab, click Share by Rules\n 2. Select the type of rule you want to create. You can build off one of our pre-existing templates or create your own. We\n    recommend choosing “Custom share by section”, as it will allow you to create your own rule that can apply specifically to\n    classes shared with Summit Learning\n 3. Create your rule. You can share classes with certain course names or numbers, grades, subjects or schools\n\nYou can find out more about setting up sharing rules in this Help Center article:\n\n * How do I ‘Share by Rules’?\n\n\nOnce you've shared data with Summit in Clever, you'll need to work with Summit to finish your sync. Your Summit Enrollment Manager\nshould guide you through this process. If you don't hear from them, email support@summitlearning.org with the following\ninformation, and a member of Summit's support team will help out.\n 1. The name of your school(s)\n 2. The date that you want to start syncing\n\nOnce you’ve synced sections, you’ll need to match courses you plan on using in the platform with the sections in your SIS. Learn\nmore about matching courses in the Summit Learning Platform with sections in your SIS in Summit's help center.\n \n\n\nFAQS\n\n\nWHY AM I GETTING A “DATA WARNING” OR A “DATA REQUIREMENT” ERROR?\n\nA data requirement error occurs when the record is incompatible with Summit Learning’s integration with Clever, and the user or\nsection will not appear in the application. Data Requirements must be resolved for users or sections to be successfully processed\nby the application.\n\nA data warning error occurs when the user or section has a compatibility issue with the application that may result in a degraded\napp experience. We recommend addressing these issues or contacting the application directly to determine the impact of a\nparticular Data Warning.\n\n\nWHY IS MY DATA NOT SHOWING UP IN THE SUMMIT LEARNING PLATFORM?\n\nDepending on your sync type, Clever either pulls data from your SIS, or data is submitted to Clever from your SIS. That data is\nthen made available to Summit Learning to sync to their system. There is a lag time between these processes, as the sync with\nClever and the sync with Summit may not happen at the same time. If you do not see updated data within 48 hours after making a\nchange, please contact Clever Support.\n\n\n\nWHY IS MY STUDENT OR TEACHER MISSING FROM SUMMIT LEARNING?\n\nPlease check to see if this user meets the following requirements before reaching out to Summit Learning:\n\n * In your SIS data\n * In your Clever data\n\nIf the user is missing from your Clever data, but in your SIS, please contact Clever Support.\n\n\n\nHOW DO SEMESTER-LONG COURSES WORK?\n\nBy default, courses in the Summit Learning Platform last the entire school year. If you need to create a semester-long course,\nemail support@summitlearning.org with a link to the course and the course’s start and end dates.\n\nIf you update or create new sections in your SIS mid-year, they will appear in the Summit Learning Platform, and you can link\nthese sections to your semester-long course.\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING FOR THE SUMMIT LEARNING PLATFORM\n\n\nMANAGING SYNCING\n\nWHY AM I NOT SEEING A TEACHER/STUDENT/SECTION IN THE SUMMIT LEARNING PLATFORM?\n\nThis teacher/student/section is most likely not in Clever. Check your Clever account dashboard to confirm that the\nteacher/student/section is there. If the teacher/student/section isn’t there, you’ll have to update your SIS with this\ninformation.\n\n\nI MADE CHANGES TO MY SIS. WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO DO?\n\nYou need to sync your SIS with Clever again, which will then allow the platform to sync with Clever. The platform syncs with\nClever each night, so it can take up to a day for your SIS changes to appear in the platform.\n\n\n\nMANAGING TEACHER ACCOUNTS IN THE SUMMIT LEARNING PLATFORM AND IN CLEVER\n\nWHY DO TEACHERS IN THE PLATFORM NOT HAVE ANY STUDENTS?\n\nTeacher email addresses in the platform need to match their email addresses in Clever. Check that each teacher in the platform has\nan email address that matches the email address listed in Clever.\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF…\n\nI created a teacher account in the platform, but a teacher exists with the same email address in Clever? \n * The platform will match the teacher’s platform account with the Clever account.\n\nI created a teacher account in the platform, but a teacher exists with a different email address in Clever? \n * You’ll need to match the teacher’s platform account with the Clever account when you sync teachers. Otherwise, this teacher\n   will have two accounts in the platform.\n\nI didn’t create a teacher account in the platform, but that teacher exists in Clever? \n * The platform will automatically add this teacher.  \n\n\nMANAGING STUDENTS AND SECTIONS IN THE SUMMIT LEARNING PLATFORM\n\nWHY AM I NOT SEEING MY COURSE ON THE PLATFORM?\n\n * MAKE SURE THAT THE COURSE YOU PLAN ON USING IN THE PLATFORM IS MATCHED WITH A SECTION IN YOUR SIS.\n\n\nWHY AM I NOT SEEING STUDENTS IN MY COURSE ON THE PLATFORM?\n\n * Make sure that the course you plan on using in the platform is matched with a section in your SIS. You'll also want to make\n   sure that you've received and recorded the receipt of, parental consent forms. Keep in mind that students can't log in until\n   their parental consent form boxes are checked off.\n\nI THINK THERE MIGHT BE A MISTAKE WITH THE STUDENTS AND/OR SECTIONS I'M TRYING TO IMPORT. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\n\n * If you import any students or sections with incorrect or missing information, it’s okay! Update the incorrect or missing\n   information in your SIS, then make sure your SIS syncs with Clever again.\n\n\nMANAGING SECTIONS IN THE SUMMIT LEARNING PLATFORM\n\nWHY DO I NEED TO INCLUDE COURSE NUMBERS?\n\n * The platform needs course numbers in order to match courses in the platform to sections in your SIS. We recommend that all\n   sections of a course have the same course number but a different section number in order to make the process of matching\n   courses easier and more efficient.\n\n\nSUPPORT CONTACTS\n\n\nWHO SHOULD I ASK FOR HELP WITH THIS ISSUE?\n\nIf it’s related to data within Clever, or data coming from Clever, please contact Clever Support.\nIf it’s related to an aspect of the Summit Learning Platform, please contact Summit Learning Support"

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nGreat Minds supports Single Sign-On (SSO) and Rostering integrations with Clever.\n\n * Single Sign-On (SSO): Users can access their Great Minds products anytime using their Clever login credentials.\n * Rostering:  District administrators can manage and update user and roster information in their SIS that syncs to Clever. Clever\n   data syncs nightly with Great Minds. \n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nONBOARDING STEPS\n\n 1. Your Great Minds Digital Implementation Specialist will send you an invitation to our Great Minds Application via Clever. If\n    you don’t see an invitation, you can send a request to our application.\n 2. When you accept the invitation, please share only schools and sections that will be utilizing Great Minds products. This can\n    be done through Clever sharing rules.\n 3. Once you’ve launched your district and shared your data with Great Minds, their Digital Implementation Support team will\n    complete your onboarding.\n 4. Your designated Digital Administrator will receive an email when your onboarding is complete. Note: Users do not get an email\n    once they have been rostered in Great Minds. Please distribute this information to the users in your organization.\n     \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n REQUIRED DATA\n\nGreat Minds requires the following data from Clever to roster users in our digital platforms:\n\nRequired Field\n\nRequired Metadata\n\n District Name School Name\n\n Student\n\n * First Name\n * Last Name\n * Grade\n * District\n * School(s)\n * Student ID: Can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores only. Cannot contain spaces.\n\nTeacher, School Admin, District Admin \n\n * First Name\n * Last Name\n * Teacher/Staff ID (see sis_id, below)\n * Email: Can contain alphanumeric characters and the following supported characters only: + = , . @ and -. \n\nUser sis_idssis_id maps to Student ID, Teacher ID, and Staff ID in Clever. sis_id's for users are required and must:\n * Be unique in your district for all user roles\n * Never be changed\n * Never be reused for different users\n * Only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (no spaces)\n\nIf you need to change a user's sis_id or reuse a sis_id (not recommended), contact your Great Minds Digital Implementation\nSpecialist to work with them to implement this change.\n\nSectiondistrict, school, name, grade, primary teacher, students\n\nEach class is assigned a unique Section_id in Clever. The section_id must remain the same throughout the school year to avoid\ndeleting existing sections and creating new sections in Clever and Great Minds. \n\n \n\nPlease note: Data in Great Minds reflects the data synced from your SIS and shared via Clever. Historical data in Great Minds is\nretained through the persistence of local IDs (sis_ids) that generate globally unique Clever IDs. Changing local IDs (sis_ids) in\nyour SIS will result in the deletion of existing records and the creation of new records in Clever and Great Minds. To ensure that\nhistorical data is maintained in Great Minds throughout a given school year, districts are encouraged to use stable/consistent IDs\nfor all records (student, section, teacher) that require data retention in Great Minds. If you anticipate sis_ids changing\nthroughout the school year, please contact Clever Support to discuss the change.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nACCESSING GREAT MINDS VIA CLEVER\n\nIf your District uses Clever access to the Great Minds platform, you may log in using one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Log in through the Clever website\n\n 1. Choose your role.\n 2. Find your District.\n 3. Sign in using your Clever integration method (email or badge).\n 4. Locate and launch the Great Minds application.\n\nOption 2: Log in through the Great Minds Digital website\n\n 1. Navigate to digital.greatminds.org.\n 2. Select the Clever button.\n 3. Enter your School Name and select the correct school from the drop-down menu.\n 4. Enter your login credentials or select an alternate login method (e.g., Google) to access your account. \n     \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nDoes Great Minds support multi-role users?\n\n * Yes. Great Minds supports multiple roles for staff users only (not students). Either using your SIS import or Custom Data\n   through Clever, a user needs two roles and will need to be rostered as two separate users with the following information:\n   * Each entry must have different sis_ids.\n   * Each entry needs to be the same email.\n   * Each entry has different roles.\n   * Each role should link to the same Clever User ID.\n\nCan we access sync reports to help us correct any rostering/data errors?\n\n * Yes. Clever sync reports can be accessed by administrators in the Manage application in their Great Minds account. See Clever\n   Sync Reports on the Great Minds Help Center for more information.\n\nCan I add users that are not in my rostering data source (SIS)? \n\n * Teachers and students must be in your rostering data source to appear in Great Minds. However, administrators can be created\n   manually in Great Minds if necessary. Contact the Great Minds Support Team for more information. \n\nHow can support staff (e.g., coaches) access Great Minds?\n\n * See Custom data: Non-teaching staff for more information on adding non-teaching staff in Clever.\n\nBy default, custom staff are assigned a Portal Access Only role in Clever, which means they will only have access to the\napplications that have been shared with them on a district level.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * Sharing Permissions: Overview\n * Custom data: Non-teaching staff\n * For Staff: School Tech Lead vs. Portal Only Permissions\n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Required Fields\n4. Support Contacts\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis guide walks through how to get set up with MAP Accelerator in Clever. \n\nBefore reading this guide, please make sure your district is set up with Clever! If your district has not been set up with Clever,\nyou can get started by going to this link: https://clever.com/signup. For more information on setting up Clever for the first\ntime, please see this guide.\n\nA personalized learning tool for grades 3-8, MAP Accelerator reduces the manual work of differentiating math instruction by\nautomatically integrating class rosters, MAP® Growth™ scores, and Common Core-aligned Khan Academy content to generate learning\npathways—complete with lessons, instructional videos, and practice problems.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\nIMPORTANT Before MAP Accelerator will be approved for setup, your district must be using Clever for auto-rostering with the NWEA\nMAP Growth application.\n\n\nIf your district is already on Clever, you can connect the MAP Accelerator application by following these instructions:\n * Log into your Clever Dashboard and select: Applications > Add Applications from the left navigation.\n * Search for MAP Accelerator\n * You will then be brought to a page where you can authorize your MAP Accelerator request. \n * You will be asked if you would like to request a custom Launch Date. The Launch Date is the first day users can see the MAP\n   Accelerator icons in their Clever Portal. Product access may or may not be available on this day and is determined by the\n   application.\n * Once you have made your selections, click Request! \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING\n\nMAP Accelerator recommends that you Share by Rules in Clever (you can find more info about Share by Rules here). Create a sharing\nrule by following these steps:\n * Subjects:\n   * Only the following subjects can be shared with MAP Accelerator: Math, Other, Homeroom/Advisory, and Interventions/Online\n     Learning\n * Grades:\n   * Section grade should be 3-8\n   * 2nd and 9th grade sections can be rostered, but are not recommended and will produce a warning.\n * Student data must include the following:\n   * Unique email address\n   * Date of birth\n   * Grade level\n   * Students can only be assigned to one class/teacher within Accelerator. If they are enrolled in multiple math sections, only\n     one of those sections can be shared.\n * Teachers:\n   * Unique email address\n * Sections:\n   * Should have unique names to avoid confusion\n * Staff/Admins:\n   * Unique email address\n   * Only users from the Staff tab can be shared, not District Admins from the Team page.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP YOUR MAP ACCELERATOR SHARING RULES - SCENARIO 1\n\nScenario 1: All math classes have the subject listed as math in Clever.\n\nClever Tip: How do I know how subjects synced to Clever? Check the Sections tab of the Data Browser\n(schools.clever.com/data-browser). Subject is one of the columns listed.\n\n\nStep 1: From the MAP Accelerator overview page, click Begin setup. Please note, if you have previously set up sharing rules, you\nwill be able to click Edit sharing.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can set up the sharing rules by clicking Share data now from the home page.\n\n\n\nStep 2: You can select MAP Accelerator’s recommended sharing rules:\n\n\n\nThe sharing rule above will share grade 3-8 math sections. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP YOUR MAP ACCELERATOR SHARING RULES - SCENARIO 2\n\nScenario 2: Not all sections where math instruction occurs have the subject listed as math in Clever. \n\nFor example, elementary school students may only be enrolled in one section where all instruction occurs, and that section may\nhave the subject listed as homeroom/advisory or other.\n\nStep 1: If you’ve never set up the sharing rules before, you will be able to customize them from the setup guide (pictured).\nAlternatively, click Edit sharing from the MAP Accelerator overview page to edit rules you’ve previously set up.\n\n\n\nStep 2: You will likely need to set up multiple rules. We recommend Custom share by section because section rules include students\nand teachers associated with the shared sections.\n\n\nStep 3: Set up your filters to include only the data you want to share. \n\nFor example, if your elementary school students are only enrolled in one section where all instruction occurs, and that section\nhas homeroom/advisory listed as the subject, you can include filters for the school, grades, and subject. \n\n\n\nClick Done editing once you are finished adding filters.\n\nStep 4: Add additional rules to capture different users.\n\nFor example, your middle school or junior high students may be enrolled in sections where the subject is listed as math. You can\ncreate another rule to broaden your sharing to include elementary students where the section’s subject equals homeroom/advisory OR\nmiddle school students where the section’s subject equals math.\n\n\n\nFrom here, you can again set up a rule with filters to include the new group of users.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Once you’ve captured the appropriate users, click Save Sharing Rules.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSHARING STAFF\n\nIf you have non-instructional staff (users listed in the Staff tab in your Data Browser) who also need access to MAP Accelerator,\nthey will not be included in a section's sharing rule. You will need to set up an additional rule to capture these users. Click\nEdit Sharing Rules and Add Another Rule to find the Custom share staff option:\n\n\n\nWe recommend taking a look at your list of staff to determine who will need access rather than sharing all staff. Once you have\nthe list of staff members ready, you can share them by using an identifying factor such as email, ID, or title.\n\n\n\nAs always, don’t forget to click Done editing and Save Sharing Rules before leaving the page!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nCheck the Data Quality tab in your Clever dashboard to see whether you’re meeting the required data fields. MAP Accelerator\nrequires the following data fields be sent:\n\nStudent: name, school, district, sis_id, schools, dob, email, grade\nTeacher: district, name, school, schools, sis_id, email\nSchool Admin: district, schools, name, staff_id, roles, email, title\nDistrict Admin: district, name.first, name.last, email, title\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSUPPORT CONTACTS\n\nMAP Accelerator\ntechsupport@nwea.org\n\nClever\nSupport.clever.com (click Contact Us)\nContact Clever with issues that relate to:\nSetting up sharing rules\nSyncing required fields to Clever \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Clever SSO via SAML\n3. Clever SSO + Rostering\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever has partnered with Canvas to create a seamless way to provide account creation, as well as Single Sign-On (SSO) access for\nusers. There are two options for enabling SSO to Canvas from Clever:\n \n\n 1. Clever SSO via SAML \n 2. Canvas SSO + rostering\n\n\nIf you are already using Kimono/grade passback and only want to use Clever for SSO, you can do so by using the first option,\nClever SSO via SAML. Choosing this method will add a new SSO pathway to access Canvas from Clever while preserving your current\nrostering and grade passback setup.\n\n\nIf your district intends to use Clever for rostering and single sign-on purposes using the Canvas SSO + Rostering application,\nplease note the following cautions: \n\n * Your district will be prevented from using Kimono, Canvas’ grade passback tool.\n    \n * Your district's users will only be able to log in to Canvas through Clever. Users will no longer be able to log in to Canvas\n   directly without being redirected to Clever to facilitate the login. (i.e. no hybrid logins).\n\nFor directions on how to log in to Clever from Canvas, please see the Help Center article Single Sign-On (SSO): \"Log in with\nCanvas\"\n\n\nSETUP DIRECTIONS\n\n\nCLEVER SSO VIA SAML\n\n1.  Add the Canvas SSO (SAML) application to your Clever Dashboard.\n\na. From the left menu bar, navigate to Applications > Add Applications and request the Canvas app. Select the option that says\n\"SSO (SAML)\"\n\n\n\nd.  Request the app and set your data sharing permissions.\n \n\n2. Configure Clever SSO via SAML for Canvas in your Clever Dashboard.\n\na.  In your Clever Dashboard, click the Canvas app, click on 'Settings,' and scroll to ‘SAML  Details.' Click 'Edit.'\nb. Set your district's Canvas domain (e.g. clever.instructure.com). Do not include https:// or any other value after '.com.'\nc. (Optional) If you would like to match users on a field other than email address, you can configure the matching attributes on a\nper-user basis from the settings page.\nd. Copy the ‘Metadata URL’ which you’ll enter in your Canvas admin account.\n \n\n3.  Complete configuration in your Canvas administrator account.\n \n\na.  Log in to your Canvas administrator account and navigate to Admin > Authentication. Click on the Choose an\nAuthentication drop-down, then select SAML. Do not choose Clever.\n\nb.  Paste the metadata URL you copied from Clever in the IdP Metadata URI field. \nc.  Optional: Add your portal URL in the “Log Out URL” field.\nd.  Click Save. \ne.  The page will reload and automatically fill the SAML values.\nf.  Test the setup by opening a new incognito window. Go to \nhttps://<YOURDOMAIN>.instructure.com/login/saml. You should be prompted to enter your Clever SSO credentials. You will then be\nlogged in and redirected to Canvas. \n \n\nPlease note: Canvas will not automatically roster user accounts from successful SSO logins. Your district needs to work directly\nwith Canvas to roster users through SIS or manual import options.\n \n\n\nCLEVER SSO + ROSTERING\n\nTo set up SSO for Canvas, please follow the directions below:\n \n\n 1. Email your Canvas contact and let them know you intend to use SSO via Clever so Canvas can enable this on their side.\n 2. Navigate to Applications > Add Applications and request the Canvas app. Select the option that says \"SSO, Rostering.\"\n    \n 3. Share Canvas with all intended users.\n 4. In Canvas, navigate to Admin > Authentication, then click Add an identity provider to this account and add Clever. There, you\n    can enter your Clever District ID, choose a Login Attribute, and click Save. Your district ID can be found in the top-left of\n    the Data Browser.\n 5. Confirm that users can log in to your district's instance URL. Please navigate to https://<your\n    domain>.instructure.com/login/clever and confirm that a student and teacher can log in to Canvas using Clever. \n 6. Once these two steps are completed, reach out to Clever Support, and we can able to enable the Canvas icon on your Clever\n    portal. \n\nIf you have any questions about setting up Clever SSO, please contact Clever Support. We are happy to help!"

Clever SSO via Saved Passwords\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nDistricts can easily set up single sign-on (SSO) for Schoology, providing a seamless login experience for every user. \n\nThere are two options for enabling SSO to Schoology from Clever:\n\n 1. Clever SSO via SAML (recommended)\n 2. Clever SSO via Saved Passwords\n\nImportant notes about Clever SSO via SAML:\n\n\nLogin pathways\nIf you choose Clever as your SAML Identity Provider (IDP) for Schoology, users will not be able to use another third-party IDP\n(e.g. Google, ADFS) to log into Schoology. Users can continue to log in to Schoology via app.schoology.com with their\nSchoology-managed credentials. If your district uses another third-party IDP to log into Schoology and would like to retain that\nlogin path, please see our Clever SSO via Saved Passwords setup guide. \n\n\niOS - Login flow\nAll authentication methods, including Clever Badges, are compatible with both iOS login flows.\n\n * Log in directly via the Schoology app.\n   If you click the app and search for your district, you’ll be redirected to the Clever login flow. Once you log in, you’ll be\n   redirected to the Schoology app.\n    \n * Log in via the Clever app (or at https://clever.com in a web browser).\n   The user will log in to Clever and click on the Schoology icon. The user will be logged in to Schoology in the web browser.\n    \n\n\nCLEVER SSO VIA SAML\n\n\nPRE-WORK:\n\nThe first step is to ensure your district users have accounts in Schoology. Please work with Schoology to ensure Schoology\naccounts are created prior to setting up SSO via SAML in Clever. Clever does not have a rostering integration with Schoology\n\n\nSETUP:\n\n\nIN CLEVER: \n\n 1.  Log into your district dashboard and add the Schoology application via this link:\n     https://schools.clever.com/applications/add/saml-schoology\n 2.  Share the users that need SSO access to Schoology.\n 3.  In your Clever Dashboard, click the Schoology app, click on Settings, and scroll to SAML Details. Click Edit. \n 4.  Enter your Schoology domain (e.g. clever.schoology.com). Do not include \"https:// \" or anything after \".com\"\n 5.  (Optional) Matching attributes will default to email for all users. If you’d like to use a different attribute to match users\n     between Clever and Schoology, you can edit them on the Settings page as well.\n 6.  Click Confirm.\n 7.  Under SAML Details copy your metadata URL: \n     \n      \n     \n     \n     IN SCHOOLOGY: \n\n 8.  Log into your administrator account and navigate to Tools > School Management > Integration:\n     https://clever.schoology.com/system_settings/integration\n 9.  Go to the Authentication tab and click Cloud /On-Premise Directory.\n 10. Paste the metadata URL from Clever in the Metadata URL field.\n 11. Click Fill fields below from metadata.\n 12. (Optional) \"Match ID to Schoology Account Using field\" should default to email. If you changed the matching attribute within\n     Clever in Step 5, please choose the correct corresponding attribute here.\n 13. Click Save.\n\nOnce you’ve completed the above steps, you should be good to go! Make sure to test the Schoology app for each user type (student,\nteacher, etc.) and on different devices before rolling out to your users. If you encounter any problems, please contact Clever\nSupport.\n\n \n\n\nCLEVER SSO VIA SAVED PASSWORDS\n\n1. District user accounts and credentials for the app:\n\n * * The first step is to ensure your district users have accounts and login credentials for the SSO (Saved Passwords)\n     application. Please work with Schoology to ensure Schoology accounts are created and login credentials are configured. This\n     must be done prior to setting up SSO in Clever. \n\n2. Device setup\n\n * * Install the Clever Chrome extension on all non-iOS devices that will be used to access the application through Clever. This\n     includes home devices for users who will be accessing this app from home. The Clever browser extension facilitates single\n     sign-on for SSO (Saved Passwords) apps. Please visit this article for more information.\n      \n   * The Clever browser extension is not required for iOS devices (e.g. iPads, iPhones) as these devices use the Clever app which\n     acts as the browser extension. Please visit this article for more information.\n\n3. Click here to add the Schoology app.\n\n4. Select Request application.\n\n5. On the next screen, select which schools you would like to have access to Schoology. Select Share.\n\n6. Select Finish.\n\nThe base setup is now complete! Please see below for more information on the user experience and pre-populating user credentials.\n \n\n\nUSER EXPERIENCE (SSO VIA SAVED PASSWORDS)\n\nWhen users first click on Schoology in the Clever Portal, they will be asked for their Schoology username and password. Clever\nwill save this username and password for future use and enable one-click access. \n\n\nIf you would like to pre-populate credentials for users, you can navigate to this\npage: https://schools.clever.com/applications/ilpro-schoology/settings and follow the directions listed here: SSO (Saved\nPasswords) Overview and Setup"

This may be the same as your AD usernames, your emails, or something completely different. You’ll be able to choose or\ncreate the format needed by your district with this tool. If you don’t know your DSU you should contact your IT department within\nyour district for the format. You can find the link to create and send your DSU field on the “Settings” page of Lightspeed’s\nprofile.\n\n\n\nThere are two different ways that you can locate user credentials:\n\n 1. Select them from the dropdown\n 2. Use a custom configuration\n\n\nSELECT FROM DROPDOWN\n\nThe easiest and most reliable way to provide your directory services username is by indicating where they are within your existing\nSIS sync. For example, if student directory services usernames are their email addresses and those fields are already syncing to\nClever regularly, you would select those fields in the dropdowns within the directory services username tool linked on the\n“Settings” page for Lightspeed.\n\n\n\nCustom configurations\n\nIf student directory services usernames are syncing to Clever already, but aren’t neatly contained in a single field, we’re still\nable to get you set up!

Once users merge their old account with the new account, all past progress will show up on their new\naccount. \n\nCan teachers and students be assigned to multiple school locations?\nYes, EVERFI does allow teachers and students to be assigned to multiple school locations. However, all schools must be shared in\norder for the sync to work accurately. \n\nCan multiple teachers/staff be assigned to the same course/section?\nEVERFI does not currently support multiple teachers or staff to be assigned to the same course/section. \n\nHow are building administrators provided access to the system and to building level location? \nAdmin can log in via Clever to access the EVERFI courses and resources.  Admin will have the same access any teacher has and be\nable to create courses.  EVERFI does not currently have an Admin role to oversee the entire school/district.\n\nWho should I ask for help with an issue?\n\nIf it’s related to data within Clever, or data coming from Clever, please contact Clever support.\n\n\n\nSUPPORT CONTACTS\n\nEVERFI Team\n\nAlice Wagner, Vice President and Dakota Rubin, Operations\n\nclever@everfi.com"

FAQs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever has partnered with Zoom to create a seamless way to provide account creation, as well as Single Sign-On (SSO) access for\nteachers, staff, and Clever admins. To set up SAML SSO for Zoom, please follow the directions below.\n\nTo configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for Zoom, you must have a paid account (Edu / Business) or a Free \"Licensed\" Trial account\nprovided by Zoom. You can check your account type in Zoom by selecting Account Management > Account Profile. \n\n\n\n\nSETUP DIRECTIONS\n\n 1.  Confirm you have a Zoom Edu or Business account by logging in to zoom.us/signin and navigating to: Account Management >\n     Account Profile. \n 2.  Under your Account Profile in Zoom apply for a “Vanity URL.” \n     \n     To ensure your Vanity URL is approved, please follow Zoom's guidelines for Vanity URL requests.\n     \n      \n      \n     \n     \n     You won't be able to proceed to Step 3 until you have received an\n     email from Zoom confirming your Vanity URL.\n\n 3.  Once your Vanity URL has been approved by Zoom, add the Zoom application to your Clever account by clicking on this link and\n     selecting Request application.\n      \n 4.  Select which schools to share with Zoom and click Request with sharing.\n      \n     \n     Tip: You can easily select all schools in the district by using the checkbox in the top left.    \n     \n     \n      \n 5.  Navigate to: https://schools.clever.com/applications/saml-zoom/settings \n          •  Under 'SAML Details' copy the Metadata URL\n 6.

This allows districts to identify and group users more\neasily. If sending additional attributes, please be sure to adjust the settings for all three user tabs: District Admin\nAttributes, Staff Attributes, Teacher Attributes and select Confirm.\n\n\n\n \n\nSchoolID\nThis field allows you to send the School for a user. The only accepted value from the drop-down is School. If selected, the value\npassed to Zoom will be the Clever ID. This value can be viewed in the Data browser or on the school's profile page: \n\n\n\nUserType\nThis field allows you to send the user type for a user. The only accepted value from the drop-down is Custom. In the box labeled\nUSER TYPE CUSTOM VALUE enter {{type}}. The values passed to Zoom will be one of the following: teacher, school admin, or district\nadmin.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSECURITY & PRIVACY\n\nData privacy is always a top priority. Only teachers & staff will have accounts created in Zoom, and only the following\ninformation will be provided to facilitate account creation for teachers & staff: \n\n * First Name\n * Last Name\n * Email\n\nStudents attending a Zoom meeting will be prompted to enter their name. Directing students to enter only their first name will\nfurther minimize data sharing. See our FAQ section for more information on the student experience.\n\nZoom is COPPA, FERPA, and CCPA compliant. Learn more about Zoom’s best practices for schools and K-12 School and District Privacy\nPolicy. \n\nUsage of Zoom is governed by their terms of service.\n\n\n\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat type of integration does Clever have with Zoom?\n\n * Zoom can be configured as a Single Sign-On (SSO) application within Clever. Teacher accounts will be provisioned on-demand.\n   Student roster information will not be shared with Zoom.\n\nWho will have a Zoom account?\n\n * District admins, staff, and teachers will have accounts in Zoom.\n\nWhere can teachers find more information on utilizing Zoom?\n\n * A full guide for teachers to set up their virtual classroom can be found here.\n\nHow will students use Zoom? Can they call each other?\n\n * Teachers can create meetings for their students to join, but students will not have their own accounts, and students will not\n   be able to initiate meetings with each other.\n * Teachers may find it useful to post their custom Zoom URL on their Teacher Page within Clever.\n\nCan we use Google to log into Zoom instead of going through the Clever Portal?\n\n * Our partnership has been designed and tested using the Clever > Zoom integration. Clever is not able to support district users\n   who access Zoom by any other methods.\n\nWill cloud storage for recordings be provided?\n\n * Cloud storage will be dependent upon your license type. The features associated with each meeting plan can be reviewed\n   here: https://zoom.us/pricing\n\nCan Staff users in Clever use Zoom?\n\n * Yes! Staff can log in via Clever and host virtual meetings through Zoom. A full guide for staff to sign in to Zoom and create\n   virtual meeting links can be found here.\n\nMy district has multiple email domains. Do I need multiple accounts? \n\n * Each district will be provided one zoom account, even if your district has multiple email domains. Please enter the Vanity URL\n   of your choice for Step 3. All teachers within your district will be associated with the district account when they log in to\n   Zoom from Clever, regardless of email domain. \n\nDo students and teachers have to download the Zoom app?\n\n * No. Students and teachers can join by selecting \"Join from your browser\" once they have clicked on a meeting link. \n   \n   We recommend turning on Show a \"Join from your browser\" link for the entire organization using the directions from Zoom found\n   here.\n\n\n\nStudents receive the error message: \"Uh oh! Zoom does not support Clever SSO for students\"\n\n * Zoom recently made a change to default settings for education customers. As of April 6th, 2020 \"Only authenticated users can\n   join meetings from Web Client\" has been enabled by default. With this new setting enabled, students will see this error when\n   attempting to join a meeting through the web browser: \n    \n    \n   \n    \n   To resolve this issue there are two options: \n    1. Download the Zoom app for the device (download here).\n    2. Log in to Zoom as the Zoom account owner, navigate to Account Management > Account Settings and disable \"Only authenticated\n       users can join meetings from Web Client\"\n   \n   \n    \n   Students joining meetings through the Zoom app are not affected. They can join a meeting without logging in. \n\nHow do I assign users to groups and licenses?\n\n * Though Clever assists with provisioning accounts, assigning teachers and staff to users group and assigning licenses must be\n   completed manually by the district. Information on both of these topics can be found here: \n   * * https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204519819-Managing-user-groups\n     * https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004976063-Assigning-a-License\n\nWho should I contact with questions?\n\n * Please contact Clever support with any questions about setting up or administering your free Zoom account. We're here to help,\n   and look forward to getting you and your teachers Zooming!"

Student Experience\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe’ve heard from districts that want to improve Zoom security to ensure the safety of students and teachers. In response, we\nhave worked with Zoom to develop a new solution for schools called the Zoom Secure Experience. This new experience “locks down”\nmeetings in your domain – only teachers, staff and admins can create meetings, and only verified users (including students) in\nyour domain can join these Zoom meetings. \n\n\nAdditionally, usernames for individuals joining will be locked. Students will have the default name: \"First Name + Last Name\"\n(Example: John Smith) as displayed in Clever. Notably, this Secure Experience does not require students to have Zoom accounts!\n\n\nWe think this is a great experience and now recommend it to our districts as a best practice. If you’d like to enable Zoom Secure\nExperience for your district, please follow the steps below.\n \n\n\nTHINGS TO NOTE: \n\n * The Zoom Secure Experience requires all users to authenticate via Clever before joining a Zoom meeting\n    \n * This experience does not give Zoom accounts to students\n    \n * These instructions assume you’ve already set up Zoom + Clever SSO for your teachers & staff. If you have not already done so,\n   please start by following the instructions here.\n    \n * If there are any users in your district who want to join Zoom meetings and aren't in Clever, you'll want to add them to your\n   Clever upload (e.g. staff.csv).\n    \n\n * If certain users in your district need to continue hosting unauthenticated meetings, you can allow this by creating\n   multiple Zoom User Groups and applying the settings below on a group-by-group basis.\n    \n\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nFirst, please confirm you have completed Zoom + Clever SSO for your teachers & staff as described\nhere: https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360040481852\n\n\nCLEVER SETUP\n\n 1.

For teachers: adding a password login for Zoom\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW \n\n\nIf your district participated in the free Zoom upgrade during school closures, the district Zoom account will revert to Zoom Basic\non Wednesday, July 1, 2020 if your district does not upgrade to a Business or Education account. If your account reverts to Zoom\nBasic on Wednesday, your teachers will encounter two primary changes: SAML SSO through Clever will no longer work, as Zoom\nprovides SAML SSO only to premium customers, and meeting length will be capped at 40 minutes.  \n\n\nIf you plan to use Zoom through its Basic service after July 1st, we recommend that you:\n\n 1. Communicate the above changes to teachers for awareness.\n 2. Let teachers know they can set a password to log in manually to their account with their email address by using the directions\n    below. \n 3. Remove the SSO app from teacher dashboards by clicking “disconnect app” on the Zoom page in your Clever dashboard. This will\n    prevent teachers from becoming confused if they attempt to SSO into Zoom after July 1st and receive an error message\n\n\nFOR TEACHERS: ADDING A PASSWORD LOGIN FOR ZOOM\n\nIf you have previously logged in SSO via Clever, on Profile, you will see icons indicating SSO, but no icon for email.\n\n\n\nUnless restricted by your Account owner, you can easily add an email and password login for the same account.\n \n\n 1.  Sign out of your Zoom existing account.\n 2.  Go to zoom.us/signup\n 3.  Enter your school-provided email address that matches your email in Clever.\n 4.  Click Sign Up.\n 5.  You will receive an email with Sign Up instructions. Click to Activate Account.\n 6.  Enter your desired password twice.\n     Note: Make sure your password meets the requirements.\n 7.  Click Continue.\n 8.  You can enter in email addresses of contacts to invite or choose Skip this Step.\n 9.  Click Go to My Account.\n 10. This will take you to My Profile of the existing Zoom account. It should now show the SSO icon that it showed previously, as\n     well as an email icon to indicate that you can log in with email address and password."

Data comparison\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFrom time to time, Clever updates our APIs to offer the best experience and strongest privacy & security controls for districts\nand application partners. \n\nIn early 2020, Clever deprecated a legacy Single Sign-on (SSO) API that was no longer maintained and did not offer sufficient\nsecurity controls for districts.  We communicated to the 80 affected application partners that we would end support for the legacy\nAPI in August 2020 and offered support migrating them to Clever’s supported API, which is the API used by all applications on the\nClever platform. 79 affected applications successfully migrated to Clever’s supported API.\n\nA small number of applications requested extra time to migrate, and Clever granted them one-year extensions until August 1, 2021,\nto migrate to the supported API. \n\nThe legacy API is now fully deprecated. To our knowledge, all 80 applications but one have successfully migrated to the supported\nAPI. If we become aware of any applications that are impacted we will add them to this list for transparency.\n\nKnown affected applications: \n\n * Sora by Overdrive (has chosen not to migrate)\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat were the technical differences between the legacy API and the supported API?\n\n * Clever’s legacy SSO API did not support field-level security controls and also exposed additional user data fields not required\n   for authentication. The supported API, by comparison, provides only the minimal data fields required for authentication and is\n   consistent with SSO APIs provided by Microsoft Active Directory, Office 365, and Google.\n\n\nWhat if an application partner wants additional fields, such as demographic data or class rosters?\n\n * Application partners are welcome to use Clever’s supported SSO API (free), or Clever Secure Sync APIs (paid), the latter of\n   which provides additional data when authorized by a school district.\n\n\nWhat fields are available to applications in the supported SSO API?\n\n * Below is a comparison of fields available in the legacy SSO API vs. the supported SSO API.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDATA COMPARISON\n\nBelow is a comparison of fields available prior to and after 8/15/2021 for applications that do not upgrade to a Secure Sync\nintegration. \n \n\nField\n\nLegacy SSO API\n\nSSO API\n\n\nUSERS\n\nUser_type\n\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nDistrict IDClever IDEmailFirst_nameLast_nameStudent_id✘Student_number✘State_id✘Enrollments✘Username✘DOB✘\n\n\nTEACHERS\n\nDistrict IDClever IDEmailFirst_nameLast_nameTeacher_id✘Teacher_number✘State_id✘Enrollments✘Username✘\n\n\nSTAFF\n\nDistrict IDClever IDEmailFirst_nameLast_nameStaff_id✘Title✘\n\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nSchool Data✘\n\n\nSECTIONS\n\nSection Data✘"

Overview of applications\n2. Setup process\n3. Recommended sharing rules\n4. Setting up SchoolPace for co-teachers and support staff\n5. FAQ\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW OF APPLICATIONS\n\nSchoolPace: SchoolPace is ARC’s analytics platform for schools and districts. This web-based platform is accessed by teachers,\nschool administrators, and district administrators. Teachers use the built-in assessment tools to evaluate student reading skills\nand record observations. Data is aggregated into graphs and charts to help schools and districts monitor progress. \n\nmyARC: myARC is a web-based platform that allows ARC to organize and distribute curricular content, digital books, videos, and\nother intellectual property securely with educators, families, and students. \n\nARC Bookshelf: ARC Bookshelf is American Reading Company’s digital book platform, and fully integrated with SchoolPace (for\nanalytics) and myARC (for sharing). Students can read digital books on the web, or on native apps for iOS and Android.\n\n\nARC Adventures: ARC Adventures allows students to practice foundational reading skills in a fun, 3D game world. \n\nARC Reads®-  A student portal for the 100 Book Challenge® and ARC Core® classrooms, offers powerful tools to enhance reading\ngrowth, practice, and engagement. With the Digital Logbook, students log their reading practice, receive book recommendations, and\ntrack their reading habits. The My IRLA tool identifies where a student might be able to handle text independently through phonics\nand vocabulary questions.\n\n\n Important note: Not all license purchases will include myARC, ARC Bookshelf, ARC Adventures and ARC Reads.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\n1. Make sure your district is set up with Clever! If your district has not been set up with Clever, you can get started by going\nto this link: https://clever.com/signup\n\n2. Submit Implementation Checklist: Once your district’s licenses have been activated, districts and schools will be emailed a\nlink to the “Implementation Checklist”. Districts must complete and submit the “Implementation Checklist” and choose Clever as\ntheir rostering method. \n\n\n\n\n3. SchoolPace Support confirmation email: Once the implementation checklist has been submitted and finalized, SchoolPace Support\nwill email confirming the rostering method and rostering dates, and include information on next steps. \n\n4. Accept Invitations: After submitting the “Implementation Checklist”, the SchoolPace Support team will invite your district or\nschool to Clever. You should see a Clever invite for each application purchased in your email inbox. \n\n\n\n\n5. Notify SchoolPace Support when Accepting Clever Invitation: Districts and schools should accept the invitation and notify\nSchoolPace Support of the acceptance. Notifying SchoolPace Support of acceptance helps ensure that syncing with Clever is set up\nproperly. To notify SchoolPace support simply reply to the email sent to you by SchoolPace Support, or email\nschoolpace@americanreading.com. \n\n6. Set sharing rules: Districts set up sharing rules in Clever. \n\n7. Start syncing: SchoolPace starts syncing with Clever on the “Rostering Start Date” as provided on the implementation\nchecklist. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING RULES\n\nIt’s important to only share the sections that are using SchoolPace in the classroom. The simplest way to do so is to choose\n“Share by Rules” in Clever. You can create a sharing rule by following these steps:\n \n\n 1. Access the Sharing Permissions page for SchoolPace. To do this, log in to your Clever account and click the icon for the name\n    of the application on the Home page. From the 'Data Sharing' tab, click Share by Rules\n 2. Select the type of rule you want to create. We recommend choosing “Custom share by section”, as it will allow you to create\n    your own rule that can apply specifically to classes that will be using SchoolPace. \n 3. Create your rule. You can share classes with certain course names or numbers, grades, subjects or schools. \n\n\nWe also recommend using this Help Center article when setting up custom sharing rules:\nHow do I 'Share by Rules'?\n\nIf you need any further assistance setting up sharing rules please contact Clever Support.\n \n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\n * SchoolPace is the main rostering application. You must set up your rules for SchoolPace and copy those rules over to myARC, ARC\n   Bookshelf, and ARC Adventures to enable sign sign-on (SSO), if purchased. If you set up rules for myARC, ARC Bookshelf, or ARC\n   Adventures that are different from the sharing rules for SchoolPace, there can be access errors. \n * Students can only be in one school at a time. If a student is shared in two classrooms, the classrooms must be in the same\n   school. For example, if you share student A to a homeroom section and an ELA section, the sections must be assigned to the same\n   school.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP SCHOOLPACE FOR CO-TEACHERS AND SUPPORT STAFF\n\nCo-teachers: The best way to add co-teachers is to add them as a co-teacher in the Student Information System (SIS) to the section\nthey will be supporting. If you manually add the co-teacher in SchoolPace, they will lose access the next day due to the nightly\nsync with Clever. \n\nSpEd teachers and other support staff: You can manually add users as staff members, through a CSV upload to Clever through your\nClever Dashboard, or by creating a custom staff account. When you upload a staff file, they will have admin access. \n\nFor more information on adding staff users to Clever, check out the following Help Center article: Clever Roles: Staff - How to\nadd to Clever.\n\nOnce the staff user accounts have been created in Clever, create a sharing rule that will share that staff member with SchoolPace\nand accompanying apps. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy is a student or teacher missing from SchoolPace? \n\n * Schoolpace is rostered nightly through Clever. So if a student or teacher was missing from SchoolPace, it may be because they\n   have been removed from the Clever share. \n * If a student is missing from a classroom, check to see if the student is assigned to two classrooms. If a student is assigned\n   to two classrooms, SchoolPace will roster the student in only one of those classrooms. \n * If a teacher doesn’t have access to SchoolPace, check if the section was shared in Clever, and check if there are students\n   assigned to those sections. \n\n\nI made updates and it’s reflected in Clever. Why don’t I see those changes in SchoolPace? \n\n * Changes from Clever will be reflected in SchoolPace the next day. \n\n\nFor support, please email SchoolPace@americanreading.com \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Setup process\n3. Recommended sharing rules\n4. Required fields\n5. School year rollover\n6. FAQs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article contains information to help your school district set up with Clever and i-Ready. You can also review the i-Ready\nrollover process to help you prepare for Back to School season. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETUP PROCESS\n\n * Make sure your school district is set up with Clever! \n   \n   * If your school district hasn’t been set up with Clever, you can get started here.\n\n * If your school district is already using Clever, you can add i-Ready by following these instructions:\n\n 1. 1. Log into your Clever Dashboard and navigate to Applications > Add Applications.\n    \n    2. Search for i-Ready and click on it when it appears in the list.\n    \n    3. You’ll then be brought to a page where you can request the application. When requesting i-Ready, select whether or not you\n       have made a purchase.\n    \n    4. You can then opt to request a custom Launch Date. The Launch Date is the first day users can access the app through Clever.\n    \n    5. On the right side of the page, you can view the fields required by i-Ready.\n    \n    6. When you have made your selections, click Send integration request.\n\nOnce requested, please reach out to i-Ready’s Roster Support team at rosters-support@cainc.com or your i-Ready Partner Success\nManager to let them know you are ready to sync via Clever. Data will not automatically sync to i-Ready as backend setup work is\nneeded to provide your district access. Their team will help you get started!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRECOMMENDED SHARING RULES\n\ni-Ready recommends that you share data by school. The simplest way is to set up your sharing using Share by Rules in Clever. You\ncan create a sharing rule by following these steps:\n\n 1. Set up your sharing rules:\n    \n    1. If you are setting up sharing rules for i-Ready for the first time, please follow these instructions: Sharing Permissions:\n       Sharing data with new applications.\n    \n    2. If you need to edit existing rules, please follow these instructions: Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules.\n\n 2. Configure your sharing rules by limiting sharing to only the schools and students that should be synced.\n\n * * Once i-Ready receives your data, they will have an additional filtering process. \n\nOnce you've shared data with i-Ready in Clever, you'll need to work with i-Ready to finish your sync. i-Ready’s rostering team\nwill guide you through this process.\n\nIMPORTANT \nOnce you have spoken with i-Ready’s rostering team and your data is received by the i-Ready team, setup may take 5-10 business\ndays, depending on the time of year.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUIRED FIELDS\n\nCheck the Data Quality tab in your Clever dashboard to see whether you’re meeting the required data fields. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nI-READY REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING DATA FIELDS:\n\nStudent Fields: \n\n * first and last name\n\n * district\n\n * school\n\n * sis_id and student_number\n\n * State ID\n\n * DOB\n\n * Grade (0-12)\n\n * Class enrollments\n   \n   *  In order to log in to i-Ready, students need to be enrolled in a class that is shared with i-Ready. \n\nStaff fields: \n\n * First and last name\n\n * district\n\n * school(s)\n\n * sis_id\n\n * Email\n\n * Class enrollments (for teacher role)\n\n * State ID\n\nSection fields: \n\n * School ID\n\n * Section ID\n\n * Name\n\n \n\ni-Ready can sync site/school district-level administrators from Clever to i-Ready.  If your district selects this option, the\nfollowing Clever Staff roles translate to the following i-Ready roles: \n\n \n\nClever Role\n\ni-Ready Role\n\nClever Admin i-Ready District AdminClever Help Deski-Ready District AdminClever District Curriculum Lead i-Ready District\nAdminClever School Tech Leadi-Ready School AdminClever Portal Access (Staff role)i-Ready School Admin\n\n \n\nUnsure of what role a user should be in Clever? Check out this article for more information: Clever Roles: Overview of Roles &\nPermissions.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSCHOOL YEAR ROLLOVER\n\n\nSUMMER USAGE, I-READY ACCOUNT ROLLOVER PROCESSES & PREPARATION\n\nIn addition to Clever’s Rollover processes, which are linked here, i-Ready also has its own account rollover process. \n\n * At the end of the district’s school year, i-Ready pauses nightly syncs through the summer unless otherwise discussed with the\n   school district. \n   \n   * If you would like to continue syncing for Summer School, you must contact the i-Ready team by emailing\n     rosters-support@cainc.com.\n\n * After the last day of school, i-Ready will be accessible to users (as long as they are rostered in Clever) until the i-Ready\n   Account Rollover, which typically occurs about two weeks before the start of the next school year. \n   \n   * Don’t you know when your i-Ready Account Rollover will occur? Ask your district administrator, or if you are a district-level\n     i-Ready administrator, follow these steps. \n\n * In preparation for the new school year, please follow Clever’s rollover processes to release your new academic year data.\n   \n   * As a reminder, the sync hold needs to be released in Clever before i-Ready can receive your new year data.\n\n\nAfter the i-Ready account rollover occurs, i-Ready is not accessible until the new school year data is shared with i-Ready and has\nbeen processed. Once data is shared with the i-Ready team, it can take up to five business days to get your account up and running\nfor the next school year. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\nWhy am I getting a “data warning” or a “data error”?\n\n * A data error occurs when the record is incompatible with i-Ready’s integration with Clever, resulting in the user or section\n   not appearing in the application. Data errors must be resolved for users or sections in order to be successfully processed by\n   the application. Reach out to Clever Support if you have questions about how to resolve your data error.\n\n * A data warning occurs when the user or section has a compatibility issue with the application that may result in a degraded app\n   experience. We recommend addressing these issues or contacting the application directly to determine the impact of a particular\n   data warning.\n   \n   * Please note that section name data warnings can be ignored for i-Ready.\n\n \n\n Why are student usernames inaccurate in i-Ready (e.g., an ‘AUTO_’ username)? \n\n * My district’s students log in through a single sign-on (SSO) portal.\n   \n   * For school districts utilizing SSO, the “username” column in i-Ready has no functionality and can be ignored.  Teachers and\n     Students should log in through their district portal by clicking the appropriate i-Ready tile or icon.  \n\n * My school district’s students log in directly through https://login.i-ready.com/.\n   \n   * Suppose your district logs in directly through i-Ready, and a student needs their username corrected. In that case, a school\n     or district administrator can update the username field by following these linked steps in i-Ready Central.  \n\n \n\nHow can my district sync demographics from Clever to i-Ready?\n\nTo see demographic reporting in the i-Ready Dashboard, you’ll need to sync demographic data via Clever by following these steps:  \n\n 1. You’ll need to sync demographic data to Clever from your SIS or CSV file (depending on your sync type).\n\n 2. Once your data is in Clever, you’ll need to make sure it’s shared with i-Ready. In your Clever Dashboard, navigate to the\n    Applications > My applications > i-Ready > Settings tab > scroll to the Field Access box.\n\n 3. Click on Advanced Settings.\n\n 4. Choose Customize fields shared with i-Ready (see a how-to here for instructions and screenshots) and click Customize fields.\n\n 5. Here, you can edit which fields are shared with the app.\n    \n    * Sensitive Student Information fields in Clever require an additional sharing step with i-Ready. Please see step-by-step\n      instructions here.\n\nType of information\n\nClever field\n\ni-Ready demographic field\n\nPersonal informationgendergenderraceethnicityIdhispanic_ethnicityhispanicOrLatino Sensitive student\ninformation ell_statusenglishLanguageLearneriep_status specialEducationfrl_statuseconomicallyDisadvantaged\n\n \n\nIn addition to the fields above, i-Ready also offers extended demographics that vary by state. Please contact your i-Ready Partner\nSuccess Manager and/or rosters-support@cainc.com to learn about extension demographic fields for your state. A complete list of\nClever demographics can be found here.\n\n \n\nPlease note that Hispanic/ Latino is not included in the values for Race in Clever and EthnicityID in i-Ready at this time.\n\n \n\nCan students log in both via Clever SSO and the i-Ready website?\n\nAt this time, districts have the option to either utilize Clever SSO or log in directly via i-Ready.com. Currently, we don't\nsupport logging via both methods, you must choose one method."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. EBSCO Information Services Requirements\n3. Adding EBSCO Information Services\n4. Additional Customization Options\n5. FAQs\n6. EBSCO Customer Support\n7. Clever Customer Support\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNow, it’s easier than ever to enhance student research and classroom instruction with user-friendly research tools from EBSCO,\nincluding Explora, EBSCOhost, EBSCO Discovery Service and subject-specific Reference Centers. Clever also integrates with EBSCO\neBooks, Flipster digital magazines and NoveList, a database of book recommendations to support readers’ advisory. \n \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEBSCO INFORMATION SERVICES REQUIREMENTS\n\nSetting up Clever to access your EBSCO resources is simple and entirely self-service. First, you will add the EBSCO Information\nServices app and configure sharing permissions within the Clever dashboard.\n\nThen, you will enable schools for Clever access in EBSCO Experience Manager. This step maps schools to EBSCO accounts, which\nallows EBSCO to direct Clever users to the specific resources for their school. This step is important because every district\nsubscribes to a different set of EBSCO products.\n\nBefore you begin, it’s important to understand how your EBSCO products are set up on your district and school EBSCO customer\naccounts. Every school and district has an EBSCO account that their EBSCO resources are associated with. When enabling schools in\nEBSCO Experience Manager, you will need to know if any schools should be enabled in their own EBSCO account, or if all schools can\nbe enabled in the district account.\n\nThe easiest way to decide is to find out if any schools in your district have subscribed to EBSCO products just for their school.\nIf they have, you will need to enable those schools in their own EBSCO accounts. This way, users at those schools will have access\nto their school’s unique content as well as any shared content across the district.\n\nIf none of your schools have their own subscriptions, you can enable every school in the district’s EBSCO account.\n\nFor help with this, you can contact EBSCO support, ask your school or district librarians, or reach out to your district’s EBSCO\nadministrator. Your EBSCO administrator has primary responsibility for configuring EBSCO resources for your school or district and\nmay be someone associated with your school library, district office, or consortium office.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING EBSCO INFORMATION SERVICES\n\nTo add EBSCO Information Services to your Clever Dashboard, please search for it from the Request Applications page.\n\nWe recommend sharing all records in your district with EBSCO Information Services. Once the sharing permissions have been\nconfigured, you will need to enable schools in the Authentication & Access module of EBSCO Experience Manager. For instructions,\nplease visit EBSCO Connect: Setting Up Clever for Your District or School.  \n\nCompleting these steps will allow users to anonymously access EBSCO resources from within the Clever Portal. All users will be\ndirected to the same EBSCO product. To change the product your users are directed to, ask your EBSCO administrator to help you\nchange the top-ranked profile so that it corresponds with that product.\n\nTo direct your users straight to different EBSCO products, you can create EBSCO links that prompt for Clever authentication and\nadd these to Clever as External Links. For example, using links you can direct primary school students to Explora, and high\nschoolers to EBSCOhost, and provide a separate link to access Flipster. \n\nTo learn more, please visit EBSCO Connect: Clever SSO - Additional Customization Options.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDITIONAL CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS\n\nOnce you have enabled schools in EBSCO Experience Manager and confirmed that your integration is working, there’s more that you\ncan do. You can customize the user experience within the Clever portal, and your district can use Clever to authenticate users to\nEBSCO resources from outside the portal as well. For more information on these options, please see: Clever SSO – Additional\nCustomization Options. \n\n \n\nYou can also control whether and when MyEBSCO accounts are automatically created for users. MyEBSCO accounts allow users to\npersistently save items they find in EBSCO products, download eBooks, and engage in other activities, such as placing a hold on an\nILS item in EBSCO Discovery Service. No personally identifiable information is shared for accounts created for students. For more\ninformation on the options available, please see How do I configure personalization for Clever?\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\nFor questions about your EBSCO account settings and configuration, please review Clever SSO - Frequently Asked Questions for\nAdministrators on EBSCO Connect or reach out to your EBSCO administrator.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEBSCO CUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\nPlease review:\n\n * Setting Up Clever for Your District or School\n * Clever SSO - Additional Customization Options\n * How do I configure personalization for Clever?\n * Clever SSO - Frequently Asked Questions for Administrators on EBSCO Connect.\n\nIf you still have questions, or if you see an EBSCO-branded error message, please submit a support case.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCLEVER CUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\nFor additional help requesting the EBSCO Information Services app in your Clever Dashboard or questions on setting up sharing\npermissions, you can open a ticket with Clever Support by clicking the messaging icon in the lower right corner of the Clever Help\nCenter."

Adding Benchmark Education\n4. Setting up your Benchmark Education sharing rules\n5. Sharing staff\n6. Next steps\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBenchmark’s award-winning print and digital solutions feature content-rich leveled texts in English and Spanish; explicit\ninstruction in close reading and analysis, genre, and cross-text study; and a wide array of differentiated resources that enable\neducators to target literacy intervention. Since Clever and Benchmark began their partnership in 2013, it’s easier than ever for\nstudents and teachers to access their learning resources.\n \n\nClever Tip: If you’re interested in learning more about Clever, such as using our SSO Portal and connecting other applications\nthrough our dashboard, you can learn a lot more here in our Help Center or by visiting Clever Academy .\n\n \n\nIMPORTANT: Please read before proceeding with the setup process.\n\n\nCommunication: Setting up a Clever integration requires a conversation with Benchmark Education Company. After requesting\nBenchmark through Clever, please make sure to email or schedule a call with Benchmark with any questions.\n\nSwitching rostering methods: If you’re moving to Clever from self-registered accounts, please be ready to work with Benchmark on a\nuser clean-up process. The Benchmark team can work with you to map accounts and avoid losing historical data. Please contact the\nBenchmark team before making any changes.\n\nData readiness: Your district should be sharing with Benchmark only the subjects and grade levels specified below in the\n“Benchmark Education requirements - overview” section. Please be sure to only share schools and users with Benchmark\nsubscriptions.\n \n \n\n\nBENCHMARK EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS - OVERVIEW\n\nHere are the requirements and recommendations for sharing data with Benchmark. Please note: school site must be shared!\n\n \n\n * Subjects:\n   * Please only share the relevant sections from any of the following subjects with Benchmark Education:\n     * English/Language Arts\n     * Language\n     * Homeroom/Advisory\n     * Social Studies\n     * Other\n   * Please exclude the following subjects:\n     * PE and Health\n     * Art and Music\n     * Math\n     * Science\n     * Technology and Engineering\n * Grades:\n   * Typical grades using Benchmark Education are K-5 but it can be used across preK-12. Please check in with your curriculum\n     purchaser to determine who should have access.\n * Student data must include the following:\n   * Grade level\n   * Username (highly recommended)\n * Teachers:\n   * Email address (recommended)\n * Sections:\n   * Should have unique names to avoid confusion\n * Staff/Admins:\n   * Unique email address \n   * A user cannot be shared as both a teacher and a staff member - one role only can be shared\n      \n\n  For an overview of sharing rules, please visit: Sharing Permissions: Share by Rules. If you still need help setting up your\nsharing rules after reading this article, please contact Clever’s support team by clicking the message icon in the lower right\ncorner of the page. Be sure to include “Benchmark Education Sharing Rule” in the subject line of your email.\n\n\n \n\nADDING BENCHMARK EDUCATION\n\nTo add Benchmark Education to your Clever Dashboard, please search for it under Clever Dashboard > Applications > Add\nApplications.\n \n\n\nSETTING UP YOUR BENCHMARK EDUCATION SHARING RULES\n\nUsing sharing rules, you can customize precisely the data you want shared with Benchmark Education.\n \n\nIMPORTANT: Please remember to ONLY share schools and users with Benchmark subscriptions.\n\n \n\nExample: All elementary ELA/homeroom sections and middle school ELA and Spanish sections.\n\n\nEnglish/Language Arts and Language classes (as subscribed) should be shared with Benchmark Education. However, you may need to\ninclude other subjects to cover your entire student body. For example, elementary school students may only be enrolled in one\nsection where all instruction occurs, and that section may have the subject listed as “Homeroom/Advisory” or “Other.”\n \n\n How do I know how subjects synced to Clever? Check the “Sections” tab of the Data Browser (schools.clever.com/browser). “Subject”\nis one of the columns listed.\n\n \nStep 1: If you’ve never set up the sharing rules before, you will be able to customize them from the setup guide (pictured).\nAlternatively, click Edit sharing from the Benchmark Education overview page to edit rules you’ve previously set up.\n\n\n\nStep 2: You will likely need to set up multiple rules. We recommend Share by Section\n\n\nStep 3: Set up your filters to include only the data you want to share. \n\nFor example, if your elementary school students are only enrolled in one section where all instruction occurs, and that section\nhas “Homeroom/Advisory” listed as the subject, you can include filters for the school, grades, and subject.\n\n\n\nClick Done editing once you are finished adding filters.\n\nStep 4 (optional): Add additional rules to capture different users.\n\nFor example, your middle school or junior high students may be enrolled in sections where the subject is listed as\n“English/Language Arts” and “Language.” You can create another rule to broaden your sharing to include elementary students where\nthe section’s subject equals Homeroom/Advisory OR middle school students where the section’s subject equals English/Language Arts\nor Language.\n\nFrom here, you can again set up a rule with filters to include the new group of users. After creating each rule, select Done\nediting to add an additional rule or Save your changes.\n\nStep 5: Once you’ve captured the appropriate users, click Save Sharing Rules.\n\n\n \n\n\nSHARING STAFF\n\nIf you have non-instructional staff (users listed in the “Staff” tab in your Data Browser ) who also need access to Benchmark\nEducation, they will not be included in a sections sharing rule. You will need to set up an additional rule to capture these\nusers.\n\n 1. Click Edit Sharing Rules\n 2. Click Add Another Rule\n 3. Click Custom Share Staff\n\nWe recommend taking a look at your list of staff to determine who will need access rather than sharing all staff. Once you have\nthe list of staff members ready, you can share them by an identifier such as email, ID, or title.\n\nAs always, don’t forget to click Done editing and Save Sharing Rules before leaving the page!\n \n\nPlease note: District Admins are shared by default with all connected learning applications. Staff, Teachers, and Students must be\nexplicitly shared with each application in order for data to be shared for each account type.\n\n\n   \n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nData errors or warnings will show up here on your Clever Dashboard.\n\n\n\nThis most likely means that one of the fields required by Benchmark Education is missing (for example, student grade). This will\nneed to be resolved in your SIS data or CSV uploads to Clever.\n\nIf you need to change your sharing rules in the future, you can always do so by clicking “Sharing by rules” on the Clever\nDashboard home page or “Edit sharing” on the Benchmark Education overview page."

Step 2: Sharing extension fields with Applications used for the TN Universal Reading Screener\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTennessee school districts can use Clever to integrate applications used for the Tennessee Universal Reading Screener and meet the\nstate’s data requirements. While solutions may vary, districts can leverage their Clever Sync and use extension fields to manage\ntheir data for the TN Universal Reading Screener. Please reference the steps below to include these required data fields in\nClever. \n\nThe following data fields are required by the Tennessee Department of Education:\n\n 1. District ID (District Number) - 5-digit ID* \n 2. School ID (School Number) - 4-digit code*\n 3. Student Unique Student Identifier - USID\n    * Clever standard field - State ID\n    *  Clever extension field - studentstateid.ext\n 4. Teacher License Number (TLN) \n    * Clever standard field - State ID\n    *  Clever extension field - teacherstateid.ext (Highly recommended)\n\n \n\nData Element\n\nColumnName\n\nDefinition\n\nLength\n\nSample Value / Additional Info\n\nDistrict ID (District Number)\n\nDistrictID\n\nThe number in the school directory assigned by the state to each district.\n\nMax Length: 3\nData Type: Numeric\n \n\nSource: School Directory / Department List Provided (column A in district tab).

The column name must begin with 'ext'.\n   * For example: Fields such as 'Teacher License Number' or could be added to the teachers.csv with columns named\n     'ext.teacher_license_number' or 'ext.teacherstateid' to your CSV files.\n * If your district currently syncs data to Clever via SFTP, you can also upload custom fields via CSV files directly to your\n   Clever SFTP folder by uploading to a subdirectory named /extensionfields. The files should be named:\n   * schools_ext.csv\n   * sections_ext.csv\n   * students_ext.csv\n   * teachers_ext.csv\n   * staff_ext.csv\n\nFor Clever Managed Autosyncs:\n\nFor the following auto-syncs, custom fields can be added by reaching out to Clever support to help set up custom field mapping\nusing extension fields.\n * PowerSchool\n * Infinite Campus Auto Sync\n * Skyward Auto Sync\n * Illuminate Auto Sync\n * Aeries Auto Sync\n * SchoolInsight Auto Sync\n * iNow Auto Sync\n\nPlease reach out to Clever Support and we can get this started for you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSTEP 2: SHARING EXTENSION FIELDS WITH APPLICATIONS USED FOR THE TN UNIVERSAL READING SCREENER\n\nYou can share your custom fields with any app by follow these steps:\n\n 1. Navigate to the overview page for the app and click on the Settings tab\n 2. Under Field Access, select Advanced Settings\n 3. Select Customize fields shared with {app} and click Customize fields \n 4. On the Edit Student Fields page, select Next\n 5. On the Edit Contact Fields page, select Next\n 6. On the Edit District Admin Fields page, select Next\n 7. You are now on the Edit Extension Fields page. Any extension fields that you have uploaded to Clever will be found in the left\n    column under Fields. Click on the fields you wish to share with the app to bring it to the right column under Share with\n    {app}. Once you have selected the desired fields to share, select Save."

FAQs\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWe’re excited that you’ve chosen to partner with Istation via Clever! Follow the steps here to get started.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nREQUESTING ISTATION\n\nIf your district has not yet been set up with Clever, you can get started by going to this link: https://clever.com/signup\n\nIf your district is already on Clever, you can connect by requesting Istation via your Clever Dashboard. Log in and select\nApplications > Add applications from the left navigation bar. Search Istation and click Request application!\n\nThe Istation team will reply to your request within 24-48 business hours. Initial integration requires assistance from an Istation\nspecialist. After the initial sync, class section and student data will automatically sync from Clever >  Istation on a nightly\nbasis.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSHARING DATA WITH ISTATION\n\nIstation recommends using a “Share by Rules” sharing rule to share the appropriate data between Clever > Istation. As a best\nsecurity practice, be sure to only share data for school sites and users that are expected to use Istation. For example, sections\nwith the following subjects will not be utilized in Istation, so they should not be included in the sharing rule:\n\n * PE and health\n * arts and music\n * technology and engineering\n * Science\n\nIf you have any questions or trouble regarding sharing permissions, please contact Clever Support for assistance. Once your\nsharing rule is set, Istation will pull data in the subsequent nightly sync.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWhy is my student or teacher missing from Istation?\n\nPlease confirm the  following requirements:\n\n * The user is in your SIS data\n * The user is in your Clever data and shared with Istation. Unsure if the user is shared? Use the Troubleshoot Sharing Tool\n * The teacher is associated with a section that contains students\n\nIf the above is correct, please contact Istation Support at support@istation.com.\n\nWhat is a custom section? Can I use custom data with Istation?\n\nCustom data allows Clever Admins to create rostering data, including fields and records, directly from the Clever Dashboard that\ndoes not exist in the district's student information system (SIS) or are not being synced to Clever. Custom data can be helpful in\ncases such as summer school, intervention groups, and after-school programs. Istation is able to sync custom data and it is\nindistinguishable from SIS-synced data within Istation.\n\nHow do I add co-teachers who are not linked with a specific class in Clever (e.g. Special Education, Intervention Teachers, Campus\nCoaches)?\n\nFollow the instructions here to manually add co-teachers to existing sections in Clever.\n\nWhere can I get help?\n\n * For issues relating to missing or incorrect Clever data, contact Clever Support. \n * For Clever data that is shared with Istation but is not syncing to Istation, please contact Istation Support: \n   * Istation Support:\n     * Mon - Fri 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM CT\n     * Main: 214-237-9300\n     * Toll-Free: 866-883-7323, press 2\n     * Email: support@istation.com"

These instructions walk you through how to add or remove\nstudent data by:\n\n1. downloading your current CSV \n\n2. making the desired changes, and \n\n3. re-uploading the CSV. \n\nWe’ll generate a new badge for each of the students you add. We’ll disable the badges for all students that are removed, so they\ncan no longer be used. Badges are not affected for students kept from the original CSV, the Badges you already printed for those\nstudents will still work.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n \n\n\n\n 1. Download your current CSV file by clicking the blue students.csv text.\n\n \n\n 2. Open the students.csv file you downloaded.\n\n \n\n 3. Add or remove students from the students.csv file. \n\n \n\n 4. Save the students.csv file you just edited as a CSV file and re-upload it to Clever GO by clicking the “Re-upload file”\n    button.\n\n \n\n 5. Once Clever GO has received the students.csv file you re-uploaded, you will receive a notification telling you how many\n    students were uploaded successfully. Please note: Badges are not affected for students kept from the original CSV. The Badges\n    you already printed for those students will still work.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

The student experience\n7. Contact Us\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Clever Portal is a space where Clever GO admins can customize the resources students can access. This guide walks you through\nhow to customize the Portal to meet the unique needs of your school.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nACCESSING THE CLEVER PORTAL\n\n\n\n 1. To access the Clever Portal, click on the “Clever Portal” box on the “Home” page or click “Portal” on the left navigation\n    menu.\n\n 2. Click “Customize” to begin customizing the Portal.\n\n 3. You are now in the admin view of the Portal and can begin customizing.\n\n \n\nEditing Page Icon\n\n\n\nA page icon will appear at the top of every student’s Portal page if you choose to add one. We recommend adding your school’s logo\nif you have one to personalize the portal experience for your students. To add a page icon, do the following:\n\n 1. Hover over the page icon in the upper left corner and click.\n\n 2. Click “Upload” to upload your custom page icon, choose a page header color as a background, and click “Save”.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING & EDITING CATEGORIES\n\n \n\nAdding categories\n\nCategories are places where you can add links for students to access. When you first open the Portal, Clever will have already\nmade categories for you based on the student data you uploaded when setting up Badges. To add more categories, do the following:\n\n\n\n 1. Click “Add”, then click “Category”.\n\n 2. Choose a category title.\n\n 3. Choose who should be able to see this category: \n\n * * All students: every student whose data you uploaded to Clever GO when creating Badges.\n   \n   * Selected grades: choose from a list of grades (year levels) you uploaded to Clever GO when creating Badges.\n   \n   * No students (hide category): no students will be able to see this category, it is only visible in the admin view.\n\n \n\n 4. If you choose “Selected grades”, you can select 1 or more grades (year levels) from a dropdown list. This dropdown list\n    reflects the grades (year levels) you uploaded to Clever GO when creating Badges. \n\n 5. Once you’ve chosen a category title and who should be able to see the category, click “Add”.\n\n 6. The new category will appear at the top of the Portal with the category title and student visibility you chose.\n\n \n\nEditing category title, visibility, and position\n\n\n\n 1. To edit the category title, hover over the title and click to begin typing.\n\n 2. To edit category visibility, click the eye icon next to the “Visible to” label, choose who can see the category, and click\n    “Save”\n\n 3. To move the position of a category up, click the up arrow. To move the category down, click the down arrow.\n\n 4. To delete a category, click the “X”.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADDING & EDITING LINKS\n\nAdding Links\n\n\n\nCategories will only be visible to students if you have added links to them. To add a link to a category, do the following:\n\n \n\n 1. Click “Add”, then click “Link”.\n\n 2. There are two types of link you can add:\n\n * * Custom link: this is a plain link that you can create to any website you choose.\n   \n   * Recommended link: this is a link that Clever recommends because it leverages Google single sign on, which will create a\n     seamless sign on experience for students. No student passwords are required to log into these links because Google single\n     sign on leverages the Clever Badge as a sign in method.\n\n 3. To add a custom link, click “Add a custom link”. Then choose an icon, title, URL, category where the link should appear, and\n    click “Add”.\n\n 4. To add a recommended link, click a link in the recommended link list. If you would like to find a specific link in the list\n    you can type the name of the link in the search field. \n\n 5. Then, choose the category where the link will appear and click “Add”.\n\nDone Customizing?\n\n\n\nWhen you are done customizing the Portal click “Done” in the upper right corner.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTHE STUDENT EXPERIENCE\n\nStudents will only see categories for the grades (year levels) they are in. In the example below, this student is in grade (year\nlevel) 1 so they only see the “All students” and “Year 1” categories. \n\n\n\nTo access a link, they simply:\n\n 1. Click the icon in the Portal.\n\n\n\n \n\n 2. Click “Continue with Google”.\n\n\n\n \n\n 3. Click their Google account. \n\n\n\n \n\n 4. The student is then logged into their account for that link with no password needed!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\nIf you need help or have feedback, please contact us at clever-go@clever.com. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Ensure settings are applied to the Organizational Units (OUs) that contain users and devices in Google Workspace\n7. Google Workspace Admin Console “legacy” view\n8. Wait 5 minutes and try again\n\n \n\nPlease note: This article is for International Clever GO users. \n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will walk you, an international school administrator, through how to resolve the most common issues you may\nencounter. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\"YOUR CONNECTION IS NOT PRIVATE\" ERROR\n\nIf your web filter is blocking access, you’ll see a \"Your connection is not private\" error when using a Clever Badge on the\nChromebook login page. You may need to adjust your web filter to use Clever Badges with Chromebooks.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThis occurs because Chromebooks don’t load custom root certificates (for instance, those used by web filters) before sign-in\noccurs. Therefore, you’ll need to allowlist certain URLs so that they are not intercepted, and the correct certificate is\npresented during the login process.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nALLOW-LISTING NECESSARY DOMAINS AND IP ADDRESSES\n\nThe following domains and IP addresses must be allow-listed for Clever Badges to function properly:\n\n * *.clever.com\n\n * *.s3.amazonaws.com\n\n * accounts.google.com\n\n * 54.241.134.131\n\n * 50.18.217.135\n\n * 54.241.154.41\n\n * 10.225.72.25\n\nFinally, also ensure ports 443 and 80 are open.\n\nWith these changes, we believe that schools using any common web filter (such as iBoss, Lightspeed, Cipafilter, Securly, ZScalar,\nNetsweeper and Fortinet) will be able to use Clever Badges with Chromebooks.\n\nIf your school network is managed by a third party IT provider, you may need to reach out to them to update the allow list on\ntheir end.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n“THIS DOMAIN IS NOT CONFIGURED TO USE SINGLE SIGN ON” ERROR\n\nIf you scan a Badge on a Chromebook and get an error that says, “This domain is not configured to use Single Sign-On”, please\ndouble-check that you’ve completed all of the steps in the “Set up single sign-on (SSO)” Chromebook directions in Clever GO. This\nerror is occurring because one or more of the steps in the “Set up single sign-on (SSO)” Chromebook directions have not yet been\ncompleted. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nENSURE YOU HAVE UP-TO-DATE RECORDS IN GOOGLE WORKSPACE\n\nPlease check to make sure that each of the following is up to date for each student in your Google Workspace Admin Console:\n\n 1. The student's Chromebook device is enrolled.\n\n 2. The student user exists.\n\n 3. The student Google email you provided Clever is associated with the correct student user. This email should be the same email\n    that the student would have used to log into their Chromebook before they had access to a Clever Badge.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nENSURE SETTINGS ARE APPLIED TO THE ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS (OUS) THAT CONTAIN USERS AND DEVICES IN GOOGLE WORKSPACE\n\nThis video walks you through everything you need to know about OUs and how to apply the appropriate Clever GO settings to them.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhen you are completing the “Configure Chrome user settings” and “Configure Chrome device settings” Chromebook directions in\nClever GO, please ensure that all settings are applied to the Organizational Units (OUs) that contain users and devices. \n\nDepending on the way you organize your Google Workspace, you may store users and devices in the same OU. If so, ensure the\nsettings are applied to that OU. Alternatively, if you store users and devices in separate OUs, ensure the settings are applied to\neach of those separate OUs.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGOOGLE WORKSPACE ADMIN CONSOLE “LEGACY” VIEW\n\nThe Configure Chromebooks directions in Clever GO currently show the “legacy” view of Settings in the Google Workspace Admin\nConsole. You have two options of how you’d like to use the Configure Chromebooks directions:\n\n 1. Follow the “updated” view directions (Badges directions and Portal directions)\n\n 2. Switch to the “legacy” view and follow the directions already provided in your Clever account (see below)\n\nTo switch to the legacy view, click “Switch to legacy version” in the banner at the bottom of the Google Workspace Admin Console\npage.\n\n \n\n\n\nTo switch back to the updated view, click “Switch to updated version” in the banner at the bottom of the Google Workspace Admin\nConsole page.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWAIT 5 MINUTES AND TRY AGAIN\n\nIf you have just downloaded new Clever Badges, it may take a few minutes for the QR codes to all be fully functional. Therefore,\nif one or more new Clever Badges aren’t working, please wait 5 minutes and try again. If you are still having issues, please\ncontact support at clever-go@clever.com."

Resetting a student or teacher's password\n\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIf your school district has enabled  Active Directory (AD), Entra ID, Google, or Clever Passwords as a login method for Clever,\nyou may be able to reset your passwords from Clever. Please note that this setup will only be available to you if your\ndistrict-level admin has enabled this.\n\nIn your Clever Portal, if you click on your name and do not see the Recover account or Change destination password option in your\nClever Portal, you must contact your district to reset your Google, Active Directory, or Entra ID (i.e., third-party) password.\nSimilarly, if you do not see the Change password prompt, you will need to reach out to your district to reset your Clever\nPasswords credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIf you do see the option for password reset, you can reset your Google, Active Directory, and Entra ID passwords from within the\nClever Portal. To ensure you can reset your password outside of the Clever Portal, you will need to set up an account recovery\nmethod.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nSET UP ACCOUNT RECOVERY\n\nYou will need to set up account recovery to have the ability to reset your password for a third-party when you are not signed in\nto your Clever account. To configure account recovery, from your Portal click your name, Account recovery.\n\n\n\n\nOnce clicked, a modal will pop up where you can select your preferred Account recovery method. Depending on what your school\ndistrict has enabled, you may have the option to enter an email address, a phone number, or answer security questions when you\nneed to reset your password.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRESETTING YOUR GOOGLE, ACTIVE DIRECTORY, OR ENTRA ID (THIRD-PARTY) PASSWORD THROUGH CLEVER\n\nThere are two ways to reset your personal third-party passwords through Clever:\n \n\n\nOPTION 1\n\n1. If you are signed into the Clever Portal, click your name, Change destination password. In the example screenshot below, you’ll\nsee the user can change their Google password.\n\n\n\n2. Enter your new password and click Set new password\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOPTION 2\n\nIf you are not signed in to Clever, and you have forgotten or want to reset your third-party password, you will need to use a\nverification code delivered via account recovery.\n\n1. To begin, navigate to your district's login page and select Get help logging in.\n\n\n\n2. Click Recover Third-Party accounts with backup login method.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n3. Please enter your school email address. If you are unsure of the email address to utilize, please contact your district support\ncontact. Clever Support cannot provide this information to you. \n\n\n \n\n \n\nAfter you enter your user identifier, Clever will send you a verification code through the method selected when setting up account\nrecovery. Once you enter the verification code, you can set a new password:\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nThe password must match the requirements set by your district. (Example: minimum of 8 characters, including 1 number). Once you've\nreset your password, you will be prompted to log in to the Clever Portal using your new password. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nRESETTING YOUR CLEVER PASSWORDS PASSWORD\n\nIf your district or school uses Clever Passwords for logging into Clever, and your administrator has enabled staff to reset their\npasswords, you can reset your password within your Clever Portal or while logging in.\n\n\nOPTION 1: RESET YOUR PASSWORD IN YOUR PORTAL\n\nIf you are signed into the Clever Portal, click on your name then Change password.\n\n\n\n\nOPTION 2: RESET YOUR PASSWORD DURING LOGIN\n\n1. To begin navigate to your district's login page and select Get help logging in.\n\n\n\n2. Click Reset your password.\n\n\n\n3. Please enter your school email address. If you are unsure of the email address to utilize, please contact your district support\ncontact. Clever Support cannot provide this information to you.\n\n4. After you enter your email, Clever will send you a verification code through the method selected when setting up account\nrecovery.

We help\nyour district's IT office provide applications with all the information they need to be seamlessly set up for your school.\n\nClever Single sign-on (SSO) allows users to log into applications with a single set of credentials, configured at the district\nlevel. With the ease of only one username and password, Clever can help teachers reclaim valuable class time. Students and\nteachers can open their devices, sign into the Clever Portal, and click on their connected applications to automatically access\nthe online learning program!\n\nClever Tip: If you notice that data is missing or incorrect in Clever or one of your connected learning applications, you’ll want\nto reach out to your district tech support contact to verify that the data is syncing from your Student Information System (SIS)\nand included in the sharing permissions for the application. Clever is unable to make changes on the district's behalf.\n\n\nWHO CAN SIGN UP FOR CLEVER?\n\nWe recommend creating one Clever account for your school district that’s managed at the district level. In order to create and\nadminister a Clever account, you need administrative access to your SIS and authority to sign Clever’s Terms of Service.\n\nExamples of individuals with sufficient access to manage a Clever account include Chief Technology Officers, SIS/Database\nManagers, and other district IT Administrators. Non-teaching staff, such as Principals, typically do not have the access to the\nSIS that is needed to set up a Clever account, therefore we recommend reaching out to a colleague at the district level to create\nyour district’s Clever account.\n\n\nHOW CAN I ACCESS MY DISTRICT'S CLEVER ACCOUNT? \n\nIf you’d like access to Clever as a non-teaching staff member, we encourage you to reach out to your district’s tech department.\nThe Clever account owner must upload your non-teaching staff record to the Clever dashboard. If they need guidance in creating\nyour non-teaching staff account, feel free to pass on this article."

Go to your district's Clever Portal login, which should follow the format: https://clever.com/in/<district name> (e.g.,\n    clever.com/in/cleverusd).\n    \n    If you don't know your district's Clever login page, you can go to clever.com/login and search for your school. \n     \n 2. Log in to Clever with your username and password. Your username and password credentials are set up by your school district.\n    They may be your teacher number, ID, or email address.\n    \n    If you are both a teacher and a staff member in Clever, you can access both user accounts using the same set of credentials in\n    most instances. After signing in, you’ll select which user you’d like to log in:\n     \n    \n                          \n     \n    \n    Please note: If your district uses custom usernames and passwords for single sign-on (SSO) (rather than through a third party\n    like Google), you may have two distinct set of credentials: one for your teacher account and one for your staff account. This\n    means your Username will be different between your two accounts. Please check with your district admin for more information on\n    what your credentials should be for your teacher account and staff account.\n\n 3. Once logged in to your Clever Portal, you can access your applications!\n\n \n\n\n WHAT TO DO IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN YOUR PASSWORD\n\nThere are a few different methods districts can choose for how you log into Clever.

Select the link for the account you wish to reset!\n \n\nIf you district has set up any other login method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClever is unable to reset your password if your district’s identity provider is through a third party. This is because we never\nhave access to your actual password in these instances.

Please reach out to the application's support team to investigate further!\n\n\nHere are examples of common errors you might see for specific applications:\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n \n\n\nCLICKED ON APP, CLEVER ASKED FOR A USERNAME AND PASSWORD\n\nIf a Clever page asks you or your student to enter their username and password for an application, enter the correct login\ninformation for that application, and click 'Save Login'. If the device has the Clever browser extension downloaded, Clever will\nsave this information and automatically log the student in next time they click the icon from the Portal!\n\n\n\nIf your student clicks on an application and sees the page below, this means we were not able to log your student in with the\nusername and password they provided. Please have them enter their updated username and password for the application, and click\n'Update & Log in'.\n\n\n\nIf you are still having trouble, please confirm that the username and password entered is correct to log into their account\ndirectly on the application's page (i.e. at schoology.com). If you can successfully access the app directly through their website,\nbut not through Clever, please reach out to Clever Support for help!\n \n\nDid you know? Applications that prompt users to manually enter credentials as shown above are called SSO (Saved Passwords)\napplications.

How do I share custom sections\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Custom Sections feature allows district admins and School Tech Leads to create and manage sections manually within the Clever\ndashboard. This feature can be used to create sections for summer school, intervention groups, after-school programs, and more!\n\n\nCustom Sections are created and managed from the Clever dashboard and behave just like sections from your SIS. Once the custom\nsections are created, districts can share them with applications through the same sharing permissions interface.\n\n \n\nPlease note: School Tech Leads are not able to view or edit Custom Sections created by other School Tech Leads or district\nadmins.   \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I MANUALLY CREATE CUSTOM SECTIONS?\n\n\nYou can create individual sections from your Clever dashboard.\n\nStep 1: Add Section Info\nTo create custom sections, log in to the Clever and select Create Custom Sections\n\n\n\nNext, select Add Custom Data > Sections\n\n\n\nBegin by entering the name and school to be associated with the section. The following fields are required:\n \n\n * Section Name\n * School\n * Subject\n * Grade\n\nOnce all required fields are populated, you will be able to press Next to proceed. We recommend adding any information that may be\nhelpful in identifying the section in Clever and connected applications.\n\n\nStep 2: Add Teachers\nNext, select the primary teacher to associate with the section. You can also add up to 9 co-teachers for each custom section.\nClever has provided filters to assist with locating staff members by school. \n \n\n Please note:Not all applications support co-teachers. We recommend checking with the application’s support team to confirm if\nco-teachers are a supported feature. \n\n\n\nStep 3: Select Primary Teacher\nNext, indicate the primary teacher for the section. If an application does not support co-teachers, this primary teacher will be\nthe teacher that is connected to the custom section. \n\n\n\nStep 4: Add Students\nNext, select students to be enrolled in the section. Clever has provided filters to help locate students using school, grade\nlevel, etc.\n\n\nStep 5: Preview\nReview the custom section to confirm the section information, including teachers and students, are correct. When ready, select\n“Create.”\n\n\nStep 6: Share with applications\nThe custom section will be available to share with connected applications following your district's next successful sync with\nClever. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO I EDIT CUSTOM SECTIONS?\n\nTo edit a section, click on the pencil icon under ‘Actions’. This will take you back to the custom sections wizard where you can\nmake adjustments as desired.\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I DELETE CUSTOM SECTIONS?\n\nSections can be deleted from Clever by clicking on the  under Actions. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I SHARE CUSTOM SECTIONS?\n\nCustom sections are shared with applications through the same interface as sections from the SIS. \n\n\nOnce a custom section is created, we recommend reviewing the district's sharing permissions to ensure the section is shared as\ndesired. You may need to adjust your sharing permissions to ensure it is included. For more information on sharing rules, see this\narticle: How do I set my sharing permissions for applications? ."

How to export data\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAt Clever, we understand how important it is to track logins and application usage among your students and teachers. Using Portal\nAnalytics, you can see graphs and statistics that show how many users are accessing their resources, how often they log in, and\nwhich schools or apps are being used the most! This data is provided as a general overview and is not viewable \"by student\" or \"by\nteacher\".\n\nThis article will give you a breakdown of the available data and how you can use filters to narrow down the information you see.\n \n\nPlease note: As a School Tech Lead, you will only see the specific data for your assigned school sites. As such, you will not see\nthe \"Logins by school\" list unless you are connected to multiple schools in Clever. If you do not see one of your school sites,\nplease contact your district help desk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get to the Portal Analytics page from your School Tech Lead Portal, you can navigate to the Clever Dashboard, by clicking\nDashboard from the top menu\n \n\nOnce in the dashboard, select the blue View details button to the right of, Clever in your school\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO USE FILTERS\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the available filters. You can use the filters to narrow down the usage data and focus on specific\nusers, applications, and school sites. Different filter sets will cause charts to change- if the filters chosen do not apply to a\nchart, the chart will temporarily be hidden.\n\n\n\nTime Range\nHere you can select the time ranges that you want the charts to show. Select School year to date if you'd like to see the usage\ndata for the entire school year so far.\n \n\nUnits\nHere you can select whether you'd like to view your data as a percentage (75% of all students have logged in) or in absolute terms\n(7,500 students have logged in). \n \n\nSchools\nAll Schools - an overview of the data for the entire district\nIf you want to focus on a specific site instead of All Schools, you can select it from the drop-down. Multiple school sites can be\nselected from the drop-down.\n\nPlease note: the \"Logins by School\" graph is disabled when you select a single school.\n\nApp\nSelect All Apps if you want to view login data for all the apps connected to your Clever account. To look more closely at a\nspecific app's usage, select it from the drop-down. When you select an app, the \"Usage by App\" graph is disabled.\n \n\nApp Type\nHere you can select whether you want to see usage data for teacher-added, district-added, or both.\n \n\nGrades\nTo look at the analytics for specific grade levels, select the grade(s) from the drop-down. Grades are based on student grades,\nnot the grade level for a section or a teacher.\n \n\nUsers\nHere you can select whether you want to see usage data for students, teachers, or both.\n \n\nPlease note: the \"Teachers\" filter cannot be used in conjunction with the grade filter\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF AVAILABLE DATA\n\nNow that we know how to use filters to focus on specific areas, let's take a look at the different measures! The statistics shown\nare based on the users who are being shared with apps.The metrics are not based on the total number of users in your Clever\naccount.\n \n\n\n\nUsage by scoped users: This number reflects the number of logins from the users that are shared with your applications.\n \n\nUnique users: This number reflects the unique number of users who have logged into an application.\n \n\nTotal Logins: This number reflects the overall number of user logins.\n\n\n\nDAILY UNIQUE USERS\n\n\n\nDaily unique users: This chart reflects the unique number of users who have logged into an application per day. Hover your mouse\nover a date to see the number of daily unique users for that day. Please note that this chart is disabled if you are using the\nSchool year to date time frame filter.\n\n\n \n\n\nLOGINS BY APP\n\n\nThis number reflects the number of unique user logins to an individual application. Click on Ascending or Descending to order apps\nby the number of unique logins.\n\n\nLOGINS BY SCHOOL\n\n\nThis number reflects the number of unique user logins from users at each school site you administer. Click on Ascending\nor Descending to order schools by the number of unique logins.\n \n\nPlease note: you will only see the number of logins by school for the sites you administer. \n\n \n\n\nLOGIN METHOD / DEVICE / BROWSER\n\n\n\nLogin Method: This number reflects the number of unique user logins by login type. Users will be counted twice if they log in\nusing different login methods- but only once if logging in multiple times using the same identity provider.\n \n\nDevice: This number reflects the number of unique user logins for each device. Users will be counted twice if logging into\ndifferent devices but only once if logging in multiple times to the same device type.\n \n\nBrowser: This number reflects the number of unique user logins for each device. Users will be counted twice if logging in through\ndifferent browsers- but only once if logging in multiple times through the same browser.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO EXPORT DATA\n\n\nLocated at the top right of the Portal Analytics page, the Export all data button will download a CSV of the data you've currently\nfiltered in your analytics view."

Check out our course Clever Academy for Teachers: Level 1 available in Clever Academy!\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article provides general information on what Clever is and how you can sign up to use Clever in your classroom.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS CLEVER?\n\nClever is your school’s digital learning platform, one friendly place for resources, communication, and instruction. \n\nThere are three core features to Clever:\n\n * Single sign-on (SSO)\n * Rostering of programs\n * Clever Portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSINGLE SIGN-ON\n\nClever includes single sign-on (SSO), meaning you and your students can log into hundreds of programs, or apps, just by logging\ninto Clever. \n\n\nHow single sign-on (SSO) works: You and students sign in to Clever, then have one-click access to your apps!\n\nFor instance, you and students can securely sign into popular apps like Newsela, Flocabulary, Khan Academy, NoRedInk, XtraMath,\nand thousands of others, simply by logging in to Clever! Best yet: it works the same at school and at home. \n\nNo more saving lists of passwords for every single program you use—just sign into Clever!\n\nUsing Clever, you can also log your entire class in (or out) of a specific app, saving time when you want to get students going on\nan app.\n \n\n\nROSTERING\n\nClever connects your school’s student information system (SIS), like PowerSchool or Infinite Campus, with thousands of edtech\nprograms, or apps, to share data and support SSO. \n\nSo, all of your students are automatically added to the apps you use every day. Yup, your programs are automatically rostered! And\nif a student leaves your class or is added, we’ll automatically update your roster overnight. \n\n\nHow rostering works with Clever: Your sections (like ELA Period 2 or Music Class) are sent to Clever, which shares them with your\napps.\n\nYou don’t need to worry about rostering—your district handles that! If you ever notice a student isn’t in a section in Clever, you\nshould reach out to your IT folks to make sure that the student is being shared with Clever. \n\n\n\nCLEVER PORTAL\n\nYou’ll access all of your apps via Clever Portal, which gives students, teachers, and staff a personalized page to securely log in\nto all their digital resources. Think of Clever Portal as your digital classroom: where you and students can find all of your\napps, along with any other resource you want to add. \n\n \nAn example Clever Portal!\n\nUnder the District Page tab, you’ll see any apps your district has added for you and your students to access.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW CAN I SIGN UP FOR CLEVER?\n\nClever is managed at the district level. To create and administer a Clever account, you need administrative access to your Student\nInformation System (SIS) and authority to sign Clever’s Terms of Service.\n\nTeachers typically have insufficient SIS access to set up a Clever account. Therefore, we recommend reaching out to a colleague at\nthe district level for assistance! Please feel free to send them this article: How do I sign up for Clever?"

Frequently Asked Questions\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIf you’re a short or long-term substitute for a school, this article is for you! This article will run through what Clever is at a\nhigh level, how to get access, and FAQs.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT’S CLEVER\n\nClever connects districts with the applications and programs they use every day. \nStudents and teachers sign in to Clever, and are then able to log in to hundreds of applications and programs. With just one\nusername and password, students and teachers can get into many edtech programs, making digital learning quicker and easier. \n\nIn addition, Clever also shares up-to-date class rosters with apps and programs, so the class list is always updated across all\nprograms. When a new student is added or removed from a class, Clever shares this update with all programs connected to Clever.\n\nFinally, with Clever, teachers have access to troubleshooting tools. They can easily help students who are having trouble getting\nlogged in, instead of needing to contact the district IT department. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY MIGHT YOU NEED TO USE CLEVER AS A SUB?\n\nYou may need access to Clever because you are a long-term sub who needs to work with students in their online curriculum, or you\nmay need access for the day to follow a lesson plan left by the classroom teacher that was set up in their Clever Teacher Page.\n \nUsing Clever allows you to better support students, whether you’re with them for a day, a week, or months.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO GET ACCESS TO CLEVER\n\nClever is set up at the district level, so you’ll need to reach out to the district you’re working at to request access.\nTypically, Clever is managed by a district’s information technology (IT) team, so you should ask your point of contact at the\ndistrict (such as the principal or a school admin) to reach out to the district’s IT team.\n\nOnce you’ve been added to Clever by the district, you’ll log in using the district’s unique Clever web address, such as\nClever.com/in/school-district-name. If you don’t know this URL, you can also click here to search for the school and district.\nKeep in mind that you must be added by the district before you can access Clever.\n \n\nTo learn more about Clever, you can check out our free, on-demand training: Clever Academy ! In as little as 10 minutes, you can\nlearn more about Clever’s powerful features and use them to support digital learning. Please note that you must already have a\nClever account before you can access Clever Academy.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWho can I reach out to if I don’t have Clever access?\n\n * Please reach out to your main point of contact at the school you’re subbing at (such as a principal)."

Overview\n2. Sending Announcements to students\n3. Viewing student responses\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAnnouncements are perfect for when teachers have something to say to an entire class of students. Teachers can send announcements\nto all students enrolled in a single class or to all students in all classes. Students can then securely view and reply to their\nteacher's announcement directly from their Clever Portals.\n\nAnnouncements support up to 450 students. Therefore, if a class has more than 450 students, you won't be able to message that\nclass. In addition, only teachers with less than 300 total students will be able to send an announcement to all of their\nsections/classes at once.\n\nIf a teacher no longer teaches a class (i.e. new term or school year), they will be unable to send new announcements to the\nexpired class. \n\nPlease note: Teachers also have the ability to send individual messages to students. For more information about Clever Messaging,\nplease visit: For Teachers: Messages\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSENDING ANNOUNCEMENTS TO STUDENTS\n\n\nTo send an announcement to one class:\n\n * Navigate to your Clever Portal.\n * Click the Messages button  in the top right-hand corner.\n * Click the plus icon to the right of Announcement to create your  \"Announcement Channel.\"\n * Select the class you'd like to create a channel for.\n * Enter a name.\n * Select or upload an icon that will be associated with your channel.\n * Click Create.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n * Next, select an announcement channel from the left sidebar menu.\n * Write the announcement in the box at the bottom of your page.\n   * Include an attachment if needed!\n * Click Send to send the announcement.\n\n\n  \n\nTo send an announcement to all students, select the All classes option and click on the class that has your name followed by\n\"Students.\" Make sure that the highlighted text under your page name shows All students.\n\n \n\nStudents can view teacher announcements from their Messages tab.\n \n \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nVIEWING RESPONSES\n\nTo view and respond to the student, click on the student’s name. Teachers will see the student replies paired with the\ncorresponding announcement. By clicking the Show more link, you can expand to see the entire announcement. \n\n \n\nTo collapse the message, select the Show less option. \n\nTo respond to the student and continue the conversation, simply reply to their response in the direct message thread and\nclick Send.\n\n\nTo delete an announcement you’ve sent, click the three dots  in the upper-right corner of the announcement and select Delete. \n\n \n\n\nOnce deleted, the announcement will be removed from the announcements group and students will no longer be able to view the\nmessage. If a student has replied to the announcement you will still see that reply in their direct message thread. \n\nRelated articles:\n\n * For Teachers: Messages"

Troubleshooting forgotten PINs\n\n \n\n\nWHAT ARE BADGE PINS?\n\nFor best security practices, your district requires a secure PIN for older students to log into Clever when using a  Badge. Clever\nrequires a PIN for all students grades 7 and above that login using a Badge. A district can choose to adjust this setting to\nrequire PINs for Badges beginning at an earlier grade.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING STUDENT PIN\n\nTo set a PIN, students will navigate to clever.com/badges, hold their Badge up to the camera, and then be authenticated to the\npage displayed below.\n\nThe first time a student uses a PIN-enabled Badge, they will see the screen below that will prompt them to set a PIN. \n\nOn this screen, the student will enter their new PIN twice and then be signed in to Clever! After this initial setup, your\nstudents will be able to log into Clever using their Badge and their PIN! \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING FORGOTTEN PINS\n\nIn order for your student to reset their Badge PIN they will need to be logged in to their Clever Portal. If your student has\nforgotten their PIN, they can log in to Clever by using a Backup Login Code. You are able to generate a Backup Login Code from\nyour teacher Portal.\n\nFrom the teacher’s Clever Portal:\n\n 1. Log into your Clever Portal and navigate to My Students > Student Roster                                                      \n             \n 2. Choose the student you wish to help\n 3. Click Get backup login code on the right-hand side for that student. You will see a six-digit backup code. Write this code\n    down and pass it along securely to your student. The code will expire in 20 minutes.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nHow does a student log in using a Backup Code?\n\n 1. The student will go to your district's Clever Portal login page and click “Get help signing in” under the password field\n 2. The student will then click “Log in with a Backup Code”\n\n \n\n\n\n 3. The student will then enter the Backup Code on the next screen, and click Log in. This will log them into their Clever account\n\nOnce the student is logged into their Clever Portal, they can reset their 6-digit PIN by clicking on their name in the top-right\ncorner, and selecting 'Reset your Badge PIN'."

Students and teachers who are not using Badges can log in to Clever\ndirectly from a Safari web browser.\n\n 1. Open up the Clever application.\n 2. Select 'Log in with username/password' button at the bottom of the screen.\n 3. This will immediately open a new Clever tab in a Safari browser.

This will open the application or external link within the original tab. If a student or teacher wants to go back to\ntheir original tab, they should use the Safari back button. They will still be signed into their Clever portal when they go back\nto it and can access their other applications from there.\n\n\n\n \n\nFor details about multiple users on a shared device, visit this article!\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGGING OUT OF THE CLEVER APP\n\nIt is expected that if a student or teacher returns to the Clever iOS application and clicks the blue 'Log in with\nusername/password; button, they will automatically be logged out of any previously running Clever sessions in Safari and asked to\nsign in again.  \n\nFor shared devices, it will be best to have a student or teacher go back to the Clever application and log in that way, to ensure\nthat all previous sessions running in Safari are logged out.\n \n\n For more troubleshooting tips, please see this Help Center article: Troubleshooting issues with the Clever iOS app."

This helps if you’re having trouble with your password.\n\nIf you are not sure what credentials you use to log in to Clever, your login screen will give you a hint! Navigate to your\nschool’s login screen, and compare the icons below for each login type:\n\n \n \n\nIf you follow the steps below, you’ll be able to reset your password if you get locked out of Clever or your school’s Google,\nActive Directory, or Entra ID accounts. It’s like having a backup plan for logging in!\n\nTo set up your backup method (if your school has this option), go to your Student Portal.\n\n 1. Click on your name in the top right so you can choose Account recovery from the menu. If you do not see the Account recovery\n    option, your school has not given permission for you to set up an account recovery option. \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 2. Click on Set up recovery methods. What options you see will depend on what your school has set up for you. \n    \n     \n    \n    \n 3. Choose a recovery method and input the information.\n 4. Depending on which recovery method you pick, you'll see instructions on what to do next.\n\nNow that you’ve set up your recovery method, you can use it to get back into your Clever, Google, Active Directory, or Entra ID\naccounts if you ever get locked out.\n\nFollow these instructions to recover your account:\n\n 1.

This should not be a personal email like\n    student@gmail.com, student@hotmail.com, student@icloud.com etc.\n    \n     \n    \n    \n 4. You’ll be prompted to confirm your identity using a method you set up in your Portal settings.\n     \n    \n    \n 5. Now you can set up a new password for your account. Just type in a new password. If your school has any rules for passwords,\n    you can check them by clicking See requirements. When you’re done, you can use your new password to log into your accounts.\n     \n    \n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUPDATING YOUR PASSWORD IN THE CLEVER PORTAL\n\nAlternatively, if you can get logged into your Student Portal and want to change your third-party passwords (like if you\naccidentally shared your password with a friend), you can do it in your Portal. Just click on your name in the top right corner,\nthen choose Change external password. You don’t need to use the recovery method for this.\n\n\n\nInput your updated password and click Set new password.

This one-page guide is a great\nresource: Enhanced Teacher Portal guide.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nEXCLUSIVE ENHANCED CLEVER PORTAL FEATURES\n\nTeacher Page Preview\n\n * This feature gives teachers the ability to get an accurate preview of their student’s portal experience.\n * To access the feature, click the More page actions > Preview Page button on the Teacher Page.\n\n\n\n\nViewing Clever IDM-generated passwords in the Enhanced Teacher Portal\nIf your school district is using Clever IDM to generate passwords, teachers can view those IDM-generated student passwords in\nEnhanced Teacher Portal (this isn’t available in the Classic Teacher Portal). This will help teachers to assist with student\nlogins.\n\nTo view Clever IDM-generated student passwords, teachers can follow these steps:\n\n \n\n 1. In the menu on the left, click on My Students > Student Roster > the student’s name needing assistance\n 2. View the credentials for the student on the right.

You can view which students haven’t activated their MFA by navigating to your Clever Portal > My Students >\nStudent Roster. If the student hasn’t activated their Classroom MFA, you’ll see that indicated by their name in the student roster\n(as indicated in the red boxes). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nYou can find instructions for students to set up their Classroom MFA here: For Students: Setting up Classroom MFA. \n\nOne of your students has lost their Classroom MFA Badge?

Teachers will see the student replies paired with the\ncorresponding announcement. By clicking the Show more link, you can expand to see the entire announcement.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nTo collapse the message, select the Show less option.\n\nTo respond to the student and continue the conversation, simply reply to their response in the direct message thread and click\nSend.\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\n\nHow can I confirm a message has been received?\n\n * When a message has been viewed by the recipient, the word Read will appear underneath the message.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCan I send a message to multiple students at once?\n\n * You can send messages to one student, or an entire class via Announcements. Click here to learn about Announcements.\n\n \n\nWho has access to my message history?\n\n * Clever Admins for your school can access message transcripts. Clever Admins for your school can also opt into a full deletion\n   of messaging data on an annual basis.\n\n\nCan messages be deleted or edited?\n\n * Yes! Messages can be deleted by hovering over the message and selecting Delete.\n\n\nWhat happens to messages when the school year rolls over? \n * When the new school year starts, if you no longer have classes with the previous year's students, you will not be able to\n   message those students and will no longer have access to their message history.\n\n\nHow do I view unread messages?\n * Unread messages will remain in bold on the left-hand side, with a blue marker signifying that they are unread. When you click\n   an unread message, your chat thread with the recipient will open and you can read the message.\n * Once read, the red notification number at the top of the screen will decrease to the total number of unread messages that\n   remain.\n\n\nIs there a character limit for messages or announcements? \n * Messages are limited to 8,000 characters. \n\n\nHow does Clever promote respectful messaging? \n\n * If a student sends a message that contains a swear word, a dialogue will display that prompts the student to confirm they would\n   like to send their message. They can choose to select Don't send and edit their message or to select Send and the message will\n   be delivered to their teacher. \n\n\n\nAt this time, Clever cannot detect swear words that appear within another word or if appended by a punctuation mark. Example:\n\"word!\"\n\n\nWhy does a message have an alphanumeric string instead of a name?\n\n * If a student's name is an alphanumeric string instead of their actual name, it is because the student has been unenrolled from\n   your class or they have left the district. We provide access to these historical messages as they may have content that is of\n   value to teachers.\n\n \n \n\n\nAre there any limitations to teacher messages due to the number of overall students enrolled in the teacher's sections?\n\n * Yes, teachers with greater than 2000 student associations will not have access to Clever Messages.\n\n\nCan students message one another using Clever Messages?\n\n * No, Clever Messages was specifically designed for student communications with teachers. Students do not have the ability to\n   send messages to other students.\n\n\n\nRelated articles: \n * Messaging - Sending Attachments\n * For Students: Messages"

How do I reset my SSO (Saved Passwords) credentials?\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSingle Sign-on SSO (Saved Passwords) applications are icons in the Clever Portal that automatically log students and teachers into\nwebsites that do not currently have a formal integration with Clever. From a user's experience, these icons appear to be the same\nas other resources in the Portal. \n\nIn order for an SSO (Saved Passwords) application to automatically log users into a website, you and your students' must already\nhave existing accounts with the website. Your district will provide Clever with credentials for these accounts, then Clever's\nsystem securely saves this login information to help users automatically sign into the website from the Portal!\n \n\nClever Tip: Make sure the Clever browser extension is downloaded on your school's devices to ensure users are able to log into\nthese Saved Passwords applications!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW DOES MY DISTRICT PROVIDE USER CREDENTIALS FOR SSO (SAVED PASSWORDS) APPLICATIONS?\n\nYour district administrator manages the process of adding SSO (Saved Passwords) applications to your Clever account. They also\nconfigure settings that determine how user credentials for the website are provided to Clever.\n\nIf they have chosen to have users manually provide their credentials, you will see a prompt to enter login information the first\ntime you click on the SSO (Saved Passwords) application in the Clever Portal.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you enter the correct login information for your account with this application, click 'Save Login'. Clever will save this\ninformation and automatically log you into the application next time you click the icon from the Portal!\n\nIf you click on an application and see the page below, this means we were not able to log you into the application with the\nprovided credentials. Please enter your updated username and password for the application, and click 'Update & Log in'.\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to learn about how Clever securely stores user credentials for Saved Passwords applications, feel free to read our\nblog post here!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO I RESET MY STUDENT'S SSO (SAVED PASSWORDS) CREDENTIALS?\n\nIf your student has trouble with an SSO (Saved Passwords) application, you can help them troubleshoot!

Backup codes expire after 15 minutes, therefore the student does need to log in before the expiration time, or\nanother backup code will need to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nTO GENERATE A BACKUP CODE:\n\n 1. From your Clever Portal, click the My Students drop-down on the left-hand side and select Student Roster   \n 2. Select the class the student is in from the Filter by class drop-down\n 3. Locate the student record from the list and click Get backup login code on the right-hand side\n\n\n\n 4. A seven-digit backup code will be provided. Write this code down and pass it along securely to your student. The code will\n    expire in 15 minutes.\n\n \n\nClever Tip: Want a downloadable PDF for backup login code instructions? Find it in the work aid section here.\n\n \n\n\nHOW DOES A STUDENT LOG IN USING A BACKUP CODE?\n\n 1. The student will go to your district's Clever Portal login page and select Get help logging in!\n 2. They will then select Students: Log in with a Backup Code\n              \n 3. They will enter the backup code, and select Log in.  \n\n        \n\n \n\n  For more information on login errors, please see For Teachers: How do I troubleshoot logging into the Clever Portal?\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPROBLEM LOGGING INTO CLEVER\n\nLogin errors can occur for several reasons. The most common issues are:\n\n * The student inputs the incorrect login credentials\n * The student does not have an account in Clever\n * There is an issue with the district's login setup\n\n \n\n\n\nIf a student is having difficulty logging in with their credentials, in the short term, you can log your student in using a\nClever backup code. However, for third-party accounts (Active Directory, Entra ID (formerly Azure), or Google, your school may\nhave enabled it so that you can reset the student's password. Please learn more here: For Teachers: How to reset passwords for\nyourself and students.\n\n\n\nIf your student receives a login error and your district's login method is Clever Passwords (i.e. 'Log in with Clever'), please\nensure the student is using the correct credentials. If you have confirmed they are using the correct credentials but the login is\nstill unsuccessful, you may be able to reset their password if your district has enabled teachers to do so. \n\nIf you do not have the ability to reset the student's password, please have them log in to Clever using a backup code, and contact\nyour district's technology support contact directly for assistance with the login issue.\n \n\nClever Tip: Your district may have login hints viewable from your district's Clever login page. If so, these may help you\ndetermine what credentials your students should be using to log in to Clever. \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPROBLEM LOGGING INTO AN APP\n\nIf a student is encountering an error when trying to access an application, please see this article.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLEVER BADGES\n\nBadges allow students to hold up a physical badge to their device's webcam to get logged in, instead of typing in login\ncredentials. Teachers get more time to teach and students get more time to learn! Please note, in order to use Clever Badges for\nstudents, they must first be enabled by your school district.\n\nFor information and instructions, please visit:\n\n * For Teachers: What are Clever Badges?\n * For Teachers: How do I print Clever Badges?  \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRESET A STUDENT'S PASSWORD\n\nIf your district's students see an option that says Log in with Clever or a third-party account such as Active Directory, Entra\nID, or Google on their Clever login screen, like the screenshot below, you may be able to reset your student’s password.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nYou can only reset students' passwords if your district has enabled it for teachers.  To learn more about resetting passwords,\ncheck out this article: For Teachers: How to reset passwords for yourself and students.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING OUT\n\nTo log out of Clever, navigate to the Clever Portal, hover over your name in the top-right corner, and click Log out.\n\n\n \n\nUsers are also logged out of Clever automatically after: \n\n * 24 hours of inactivity \n * The browser is quit (e.g. \"Quit Google Chrome\").\n   Closing the browser window will not log the user out of Clever. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \nHOW DO I GET HELP?\n\nLogin credentials for Clever are managed by the school district. If you are unsure of your login credentials or receive an error,\nplease reach out to your district support contact or the district's help desk for assistance. \n\nYou can find your district's technology support contact information on the Clever login screen. In most cases, districts provide\nan email address, phone number, or instructions guiding users to the appropriate contact person or department for assistance.\n\n\n\n \n\ntags: password reset for students"

Make sure Block All Cookies is toggled off -- you will know it is off when the slider\n   turns grey.\n * Ensure Javascript is enabled for Safari. You can adjust this by navigating to Settings > Safari > Javascript.\n * Ensure camera access is enabled for Safari. You can adjust this by navigating to Settings > Safari > Camera.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nADVANCED TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n * Ensure that on the device, the iOS network deny list is not enabled. You can adjust this by navigating to Settings > General >\n   Restrictions > Websites.\n * Ensure that requests to Clever servers are not blocked or filtered by a firewall or network filtering software. See our Help\n   Center article: Which Clever's domains should my network grant access?\n * In iOS 13, Safari has a new setting option that is enabled by default after updating an iPad from iOS 12. Please ensure that\n   Safari's setting for “Request Desktop Website” is disabled. You can adjust this by navigating to Settings > Safari > Request\n   Desktop Website.\n * In iOS 14, users have the ability to choose a default browser other than Safari. Please ensure that Safari is the default\n   browser for any device that will be used with the Clever app. You can adjust this by navigating to Settings > Browser > Safari.\n * Ensure that no other software affects the way that Safari operates.\n\n\nIf the issue still persists, feel free to open a ticket with Clever Support!"

How do I log out of Clever and applications while using an iPad?\n4. What is the shared devices notification?\n5. What about time-out and inactivity?\n\n \n\n\nHOW SHOULD STUDENTS LOG OUT OF CLEVER AND CONNECTED APPS?\n\nWhen logging out, it's important to remember that single sign-on (SSO) can actually be broken down to up to three separate login\nprocesses behind the scenes:\n\n 1. Identity provider login (e.g. Google or Active Directory)\n 2. Clever login\n 3. Application login (e.g. Khan Academy)\n\nIf a student is accessing a shared device, we recommend that they log out of each application and device after their session.\nStudents should log out of the application, the Clever Portal, and the identity provider (Google, ADFS, etc.).\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO STUDENTS LOG OUT OF THE CLEVER PORTAL ON ANY DEVICE?\n\nUsers can log out of the Clever Portal by navigating to the top right corner of their Portal (where they can find their name), and\nclicking Log out.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW DO I LOG OUT OF CLEVER AND APPLICATIONS WHILE USING AN IPAD?\n\nOn the iPad, double click the home button (on newer iPad Pros, swipe up from the bottom of the display) to expose the application\nthumbnails. Swipe up on the Clever app and any learning apps that were launched. This will end a student's session when the device\nis shared. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE \"SHARED DEVICES NOTIFICATION\"?\n\nOn certain devices, upon initial sign-in to Clever, students will be asked whether or not they should be remembered on the device.\nIf they select No, only I use it, their Clever session will remain intact for 2 hours. \n \n\n\n\nIf the user selects Yes, Clever will treat the device as a shared device. In this case, users will be prompted with an option to\nsign in as a different user after 10 minutes of inactivity on the Clever portal.\n\n \n\nClever Tip: this feature gives users who share devices the option to log into another account, in case the best log-out practices\nwere not followed \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT ABOUT TIME-OUT AND INACTIVITY?\n\nUsers are logged out of Clever automatically if: \n\n * If a user is inactive in Clever for 24 hours, they will automatically be logged out. Currently, there is no way to customize\n   this behavior.\n    \n * The browser is quit (e.g. \"Quit Google Chrome\").\n   Closing the browser window will not log the user out of Clever."

Searching for resources\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn this article, you can learn more about what Clever is and how to use it in your class. If you are struggling to log into\nClever, try reviewing this article. If you are experiencing any other type of issue, please reach out to your teacher.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT IS CLEVER?\n\nClever is an easy way for you to access all your learning applications. With Clever, you only have to remember one username and\npassword, or use a Clever Badge, to log into all your applications.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO)?\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) is what Clever uses to log you into all your learning applications. You only have to sign in once (a single\nsign-on) to the Clever Portal, then you can click on your learning applications without signing in again!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE CLEVER PORTAL?\n\nThe Clever Portal is where you can access all your learning applications. Here is an example of a student's Clever Portal:\n\n\n\nYour Clever Portal might look different, depending on the applications your school has added to Clever. If you are missing an\napplication you need in your Clever Portal, contact your teacher! \n\n\nIf your Portal has a lot of icons and resources, consider “favoriting” and searching for the icons and applications you use the\nmost!\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nFAVORITING APPLICATIONS\n\nHere's how to favorite an application:\n\n 1. Log into your Portal at your district specific URL (ask your teacher if you need help with this step!) \n 2. Scroll to the appropriate application icon and click the heart in the upper right-hand corner of the icon\n 3. This will add the application to the 'Favorites' category at the top of your Portal\n\n\nTo remove an application from your ‘Favorites’, simply click the heart again in the top right corner!\n \n\nPlease note: Favoriting resources is only reflected in individual portals. Resources that teachers favorite will not be favorited\nfor their students.  \n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\n\nSEARCHING FOR RESOURCES\n\nYou can also search for district added resources and links and your teachers' pages. Simply navigate to the search bar at the top\nof your Clever Portal. When a result is clicked, you will be able to immediately be logged into the resource or redirected to the\nlink or teacher page."

To get into Clever, go to your school’s Clever login page. If you don’t know the page, visit clever.com/login and search for\n    your school or district. If you can’t find it, ask your teacher for help!\n     \n\n 2. To log in, use the username and password your school gave you. It might be your student number, ID, or email. If you’re not\n    sure what they are, ask your teacher for help.\n     \n\n 3. From your Clever Portal, click on the application icon you’d like to use!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOG IN WITH CLEVER PASSWORDS\n\n\n\nIf you are using the Log in with Clever button, you’ll need to use the username and password from your school. It might be your\nstudent number, ID, or email address.\n\nIf you see the error Invalid username or password, this means that the username and/or password you have entered aren’t correct\nfor your Clever account. Please ask your teacher for help.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOG IN WITH GOOGLE\n\n\n\nIf you are using the Log in with Google button, you’ll need to use your school Google email and password to log into your Clever\naccount.\n\nIf you see the error message \"Wrong password. Try again', this means that either your email or password is incorrect. Please ask\nyour teacher for help.\n\nIf you see a message saying “Uh oh! We couldn’t sign you in with Google email: xxxx@example.com,” it means the email you used\nisn’t the one linked to your Clever account. Make sure you’re using the email your school gave you.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN WITH ACTIVE DIRECTORY \n\n\n\nIf you click the Log in with Active Directory button, you’ll be taken to sign in with your school account through Active Directory\nFederation Services or Microsoft360. Use the username and password your school gave you. This is usually the same email and\npassword you use to log on to school computers.\n\n\n\nIf you see a message similar to Incorrect user ID or password, please contact your teacher for assistance.\n\nIf you click on Log in with Active Directory or Log in with Office365 and the login page fails to load, try clearing your cache.\nIf accessing Clever from a Chromebook, we recommend signing out of the Chromebook and restarting the device.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUSING A BACKUP CODE\n\nIf you don’t know your Clever login info, your teacher can give you a Backup Code to help you log in.

This helps if you’re having trouble with your password.\n\n \n\nFind our step-by-step student guide for account recovery and password resets here.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING OUT\n\nTo log out of Clever, navigate to the Clever Portal, hover over your name in the top-right corner, and click Log out.\n\nUsers are also logged out of Clever automatically after: \n\n * 24 hours of inactivity \n * The browser is quit (e.g. \"Quit Google Chrome\").\n   Closing the browser window will not log the user out of Clever. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I GET HELP?\n\nNeed help? \n\nYour school manages your login info.

Additional Resources\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMany of the nation’s largest school districts rely on Clever to sync student information with learning applications, in part\nbecause security is a top priority. Clever keeps student information safe by ensuring:\n \n\n * Full district control over data access rights at all times;\n * A robust privacy policy that governs Clever's use of student data; and\n * Protection through a tested and secure infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFULL DISTRICT CONTROL\n\nDistricts control data access at all points in the process, from signup all the way through account provisioning. Districts\ndetermine:\n \n\n * What data Clever can access (always read-only);\n * How often they sync data with Clever;\n * Which applications can access data; and\n * How much data each application can access (via data sharing permissions).\n\n\nDistricts can fine-tune these settings at any time through the Clever Dashboard. If a district chooses to discontinue their Clever\nsync, they can do so at any time. Clever will delete their account and remove any residual data immediately upon request.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nSTUDENT DATA PRIVACY AT CLEVER\n\nClever syncs basic information to manage user accounts in online learning applications, such as student and teacher identifiers,\nsection names, and enrollment information.\n \n\nAll rostering data that is synced with Clever is protected by industry-leading infrastructure (see below). Clever will never use\nor sell student information for marketing or other purposes.\n \n\nAdditionally, Clever adheres to FERPA compliance under the FTC's School Officials Exemption, meaning that Clever provides a\nservice on behalf of schools that schools themselves would usually provide. Furthermore, all Clever-supported applications agree\nto adhere to FERPA requirements in the terms of our partnership.\n \n\nTo learn more about data privacy, you can read Clever's full Privacy Policy.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nClever has spent years developing one of the best security infrastructures in K-12 education. Key features of Clever's\nindustry-leading infrastructure are:\n \n\n * AES256 data encryption for data at rest;\n * TLS with strong ciphers, with a preference for those with perfect-forward secrecy, for data in transit;\n * Multiple factor authentication;\n * Third-party security audits and code reviews;\n * Responsible disclosure (“bug bounty”) program;\n * Full-time security administrator; and\n * Employee background checks.\n\n\nThe syncing process is encrypted at all times using 256-bit encryption, which is double the standard used by the consumer banking\nindustry. In addition, Clever's production environment is completely isolated from the internet, and all access is logged and\nsecured using multiple factor authentication.\n \n\nClever has a full-time security administrator and invests in regular third-party audits in order to ensure continual improvement\nof security protocols.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\nTo learn more about our security practices, you can read our comprehensive security program."

Devices without cameras\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever Badges are an easy and secure way for your student to log in to Clever by scanning a Badge into a device's webcam rather\nthan needing to enter a username and password! Badges are tied to the student. As such, changes in school, teacher, or section\nwill not affect the Badge.  \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN WITH A BADGE\n\n1. Your student will first need to obtain a Clever Badge from their teacher or school. \n\n2. Then, they will navigate to the Clever login page for your student's district, or go directly to clever.com/badges. Please do\nnot attempt to use a QR reader to log your student in. Clever Badges are designed to be used directly with Clever and a QR reader\nwon't log your student into Clever.\n\n * Please note: There may be multiple schools by the same name, so please be sure to select the school associated with your\n   student's school district!\n\n3. Select the Clever Badge Log in option. \n \n\n          \n\n4. Your internet browser may ask you to allow clever.com to use your device's camera. Select Allow.\n \n\n          \n\n5.

Logging out\n\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe first step to log your student into Clever is ensuring you are using a Clever-compatible device or browser. Please visit this\narticle for details. Once you have confirmed your device is compatible, you can navigate to your district's Clever login page, or\nto clever.com/login to search for your student's school in order to log in.\n\n * Please note: There may be multiple schools by the same name, so please be sure to select the school associated with your\n   student's school district! If you cannot find their school, please ask their teacher how to log in to Clever. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW DO I GET HELP?\n\nLogin credentials for Clever are managed by the school district. If you are unsure of your student's login credentials, receive an\nerror when logging in, or your student's login suddenly stops working, please reach out to your teacher or the district's help\ndesk for assistance. \n \n\nYou can find your district's technology support contact information on the Clever login screen. In most cases, districts provide\nan email address, phone number, or instructions guiding users to the appropriate contact person or department for assistance.\n \n\nIf you do not see a support contact listed, please contact your student's teacher. \n\n\n\n           \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGIN DIRECTIONS\n\nPlease navigate to the appropriate section below for instructions specific to your district's login method (e.g. Google, Active\nDirectory, etc.).\n \n\n\nLOG IN WITH CLEVER\n\n\n\nIf your student is using the Log in with Clever option, or only has the option to enter a username and password, enter their\ndistrict credentials.\n\nIf your student receives an error stating Invalid username or password, this means the credentials your student has entered are\nincorrect for their Clever account.\n\nIf allowed by your district, your student can select the Get help logging in! option to reset their password.\n\nPlease note: Not all districts allow students to reset their own passwords. If you do not see the password reset option, or if\nthis doesn't resolve the issue, please reach out to your student's teacher or school administrator for help with their Clever\ncredentials.\n\n\n\nLOG IN WITH GOOGLE\n\n\n\nIf your student is using the Log in with Google option, they will be redirected to sign in using their school-provided email\naddress and password. They will not log in using a personal Google (@gmail.com) email address. \n\nIf your student receives one of the below errors, here is what to do: \n\n * Wrong password. Try again or click Forgot password to reset it: This means they entered an incorrect password for their\n   school-provided email address. They will need to enter the correct password for their account or reset it (if applicable).\n * Uh oh! We were not able to authenticate using Google email: xxxx@example.com: This means that the school-provided email address\n   they entered is not the same one linked to their Clever account. Please make sure you are using their school-provided email\n   address.\n\nPlease note: Your student's login credentials are configured by the school district. If you are unsure what they are or are unable\nto reset your student's password, please visit this section.\n\n\n\nLOG IN WITH ACTIVE DIRECTORY \n\n\n\n * If your student is using the Log in with Active Directory method, they will be redirected to sign in to their school district's\n   account through Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). Student usernames and passwords for ADFS are managed by your\n   student's district administration. Clever does not have access to these credentials. Their credentials are usually the email\n   and password they use to log in to their computer at school.\n   * Please see this section if the login credentials are unsuccessful.\n\n\nLOG IN WITH BADGES\n\n * Select the Clever Badge log in option. You can also go directly to clever.com/badges.\n\n          \n\n * Your internet browser may ask you to allow clever.com to use your device's camera. Select Allow.\n\n          \n\n * Hold your student's Badge up to the device's camera and wait for the green checkmark to log your student into Clever!\n\n         \n\nPlease visit this article for additional instructions for helping your student log in with a Badge.\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLOGGING OUT\n\nTo log out of Clever, navigate to the Clever Portal, hover over your student's in the top-right corner, and click Log out.\n\nUsers are also logged out of Clever automatically after: \n\n * 24 hours of inactivity \n * The browser is quit (e.g. Quit Google Chrome).\n   Note: Closing the browser window will not log the user out of Clever."

Here are some steps you can take to help\nyour student if they are having trouble with a specific application.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAPP IS MISSING \n\nIf your student is missing an application in Clever, please ask your student's teacher for help. Your student's school or district\nwill likely need to add the app to their Clever Portal for them. \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLICKED ON APP, RECEIVED AN ERROR\n\nIf your student clicks on an app icon in their Clever Portal and receives an error from the app's website page, please ask your\nstudent's teacher to contact the district administrator or the application's support team for help.\n \n\nPlease note: If your student has recently changed schools or classes, please allow 24 hrs for their connected applications to be\nupdated so they can log in.\n \n\nClever Tip: If you are seeing an error at a web URL that is not a Clever address, it will be necessary to contact the application\nto fix the issue. Please have your student's teacher reach out to the application's support team to investigate further!\n\n\nHere are examples of common errors you might see for specific applications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCLICKED ON APP, CLEVER ASKED FOR A USERNAME AND PASSWORD\n\nDid you know? Applications that show a Clever prompt to enter usernames and passwords require the Clever browser extension. Please\nsee this article for details.\n\n\nIf a Clever page asks your student to enter a username and password for an application, enter the correct login information for\nthat application, and click 'Save Login'. Clever will save this information and automatically log your student in next time they\nclick the icon from the Portal! \n\n\n\nIf your student clicks on an application and sees the page below, this means the login credentials they entered are incorrect.\nPlease enter your student's correct username and password for the application, and then select Update & Log in.\n\n\n\nIf you are still having trouble, ask your student's teacher to make sure you have the right username and password. They can\ncontact Clever Support if further help is needed!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nPROBLEMS WITHIN APPS\n\nAfter your student is logged into an app successfully through Clever, any issues within the app would need to be addressed by the\napp provider. \n \n\nClever is not able to resolve issues within the various applications. One way to think of it is, Clever helps a student \"get in\nthe door\" of an application but, once inside, we have little insight into any issues that come up. Some issues might include:\n \n\n * The app freezing\n * Not being able to access grades or textbooks\n * Your student runs out of time during a test\n * The app suddenly logs your student out\n * Missing lessons or assignments\n * Accessing the microphone or camera\n\nIf your student is running into an issue within the application, please ask your student's teacher to contact the application's\nsupport team for help."

Who can see these messages?\n6. How does Clever promote respectful messaging?\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTeachers and students can chat back and forth with Messages right from the Clever Portal! From your students' Messages page, any\nof their teachers who have enabled Messages will be listed and available to receive a chat from your student's Clever Portal.\nPlease note that students do not have the ability to message other students. To find out more about how messaging works, read\nbelow! \n \n\n\nSENDING AND RECEIVING MESSAGES\n\nAs long as one of their teachers has Messages turned on, your student will see the Messages icon in their Clever Portal.\n\nWhen they receive a message from a teacher, they will be notified at the top of your Portal.  Read below to learn about how to set\nup Message notifications. \n \n\n \n\nFrom the Messages page, they can view new and previous messages from their teachers and send a reply to continue the\nconversation. \n \n\nOn the left-hand side, they will see any of their teachers who have Messages turned on. From there, they can start or continue a\nchat with any of these teachers. \n \n\n\n\nPlease note: If a teacher has never turned their Messages on their name will not be listed. \n\n\n\nMESSAGE NOTIFICATIONS\n\nComing soon! Students can customize their Messages settings to allow for sound and browser notifications. When your student\nreceives a message from a teacher they can choose to be notified by a sound, through their browser, or both!\n \n\nTo start, they will need to navigate to the Messages tab in their Clever Portal. From there, they will select the new 'Settings'\nbutton.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nBROWSER NOTIFICATIONS\n\nBy default, browser notifications will be set to 'off'; however, you can update this at any time! \n \n\nIf you'd like to enable browser notifications, toggle the 'Browser notifications' button to 'on'.\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen turning browser notifications on, a pop-up window will open asking if you'd like to 'Allow' or 'Block' these notifications.\nTo continue with turning your browser notifications on, select 'Allow'. \n \n\n\n\n\nOnce you have selected 'Allow' the 'Browser notifications' toggle will be green.\n \n\n\n\n\nIf you choose to 'Block' notifications the toggle will become disabled. To enable browser notifications in the future, you will\nneed to go to your browser preferences and enable them from there. (See these resources for Chrome , Firefox , Safari , and Edge\n). \n \n\n\n\n\nWhen you're done, simply select 'Save' and your settings will be updated!\n\n\n\nSOUND NOTIFICATIONS\n\nBy default, sound notifications will be set to 'on', but you can adjust this at any time! From the Messages page, select\n'Settings' and toggle the 'Sound notifications' button 'on' or 'off'. A green toggle will indicate that the sound notifications\nare 'on'.\n \n\n\n\nWhether turning the notifications on or off, don't forget to select 'Save' once you're done. You can always edit these settings as\nneeded!\n \n\n\nWHAT IF A TEACHER TURNS OFF MESSAGES?\n\nTeachers can turn off their messages at any time. \n \n\nIf a teacher has turned off Messages, your student will be notified and will not be able to chat with that teacher until they have\nturned Messages back on.\n\n\n\n\nWHO CAN SEE THESE MESSAGES?\n\nAll Message history will be saved for the rest of the school year and can be requested from Clever by a Clever District\nAdministrator. \n\n\nHOW DOES CLEVER PROMOTE RESPECTFUL MESSAGING? \n\nIf a student sends a message that contains a swear word, a dialogue will display that prompts the student to confirm they would\nlike to send their message. They can choose to select Don't send and edit their message or to select Send and the message will be\ndelivered to their teacher. \n\nAt this time, Clever cannot detect swear words that appear within another word or if appended by a punctuation mark. Example:\n\"word!\""

Troubleshooting\n\n \n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) allows students and teachers to log in to your application through Clever. This means that as an application\npartner, you support every Identity Provider (IdP) that Clever supports!\n\n\n\nHOW DOES SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) WORK?\n\nWhile users may see logging into your application to Clever as one quick step, behind the scenes, single sign-on (SSO) actually\nconsists of three separate logins:\n\n * A user logs in to Clever via the district's Identity Provider (IDP) (e.g. Active Directory, Google, etc.) from the Clever login\n   page.\n * Clever authenticates the user through the district's IDP.\n * If the user is verified, Clever creates a \"token\" (i.e. a piece of data) that identifies the user and then logs them\n   in successfully.\n * The user then clicks on the appropriate application icon to open an application, and Clever provides the user's token to the\n   application which authenticates the user. This means the user does not need to enter login credentials a second time. \n * The user is logged into the application successfully!\n\n\nHOW DO USERS LOG INTO THE IDP?\n\nWhen users access the Clever Portal or an Instant Login Link, they’ll be taken to their district’s login page. When they click on\none of the “Log in with <IdP>” buttons, they’ll be redirected to their identity provider to log in.\n\n\n \n\nIf users are already logged into their IdP, they will not need to log in again - they’ll skip right to the “Logging in with\nClever” step.\n\nPlease note: If a district's IdP for Clever is LDAPS, a user is authenticated to Active Directory locally, and their district’s\nchosen identity provider is LDAPS, they will need to enter in their Active Directory credentials to log in to Clever. This is a\nlimitation of the LDAP protocol.\n\n \n\n\nCAN USERS SKIP THE 'LOG IN WITH IDP' PAGE?\n\nUsers can skip this page by appending\n\n ‘?skip’ \n\nto the end of the Clever Portal or Instant Login Link URL (ex. https://clever.com/in/<shortname>?skip).\n \n\nPlease note: The above is for districts with a single IdP. If a district has multiple IdPs, they should contact Clever Support.\n\n \n\n\nLOGGING IN TO CLEVER\n\nOnce the user is logged into their IdP, it will securely send a piece of identifying information to Clever and tells us what that\ndata should match in our records. This is generally non-PII information such as student number, sis id, or email. More information\non this can be found in our article on Claims Rules.\n \n\nPlease note: The identifying information that we receive is never the users' IdP credentials.\n\n \n\n\nLOGGING IN TO YOUR APP\n\nThe user can then log in to your application by clicking on the icon in their Clever Portal (or if they’re using Instant Login\nlinks, they’ll automatically start the login process).\n \n\nInstant Login uses the OAuth2, an open standard for securely accessing information. Here’s how it works:\n \n\n 1. Clever redirects the user to a special URL for your application, along with a code.\n 2. Your application automatically uses the code to ask Clever for a token that grants additional access to our API.\n 3. Clever checks the code and the application credentials to make sure they are valid before returning an API token.\n 4. Your application uses the API token to get basic information about the user - at the very least, it will get the district id,\n    user Clever id, and user type.\n 5. Depending on your implementation, your app may then search for the user in your existing database and/or provision an account\n    for the user.\n\n \n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\nWhile it looks simple to the end user, there’s definitely a lot of moving parts! For help with login issues, check out our\nTroubleshooting Resources."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. Switching to a new API version\n3. Releasing a new API version\n4. Deprecating an existing API version\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever is committed to providing the best experience for developers building on our platform. In order to make it easier and\nfaster to build on Clever, we constantly improve by adding new features and deprecating ones that are redundant. Here’s what to\nexpect from Clever when we make changes to our API.\n \n\n\nSWITCHING TO A NEW API VERSION\n\nAs of Back to School 2021, you will need to set the major version (e.g. v1, v2) that you will be using in production. If you are\nmoving between major versions in production, please reach out to our Partner Engineering team to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n\nWithin a major version, you can freely make calls against any associated minor version (for example, you could use both 2.0 and\n2.1, but not 3.0) by updating your URLS (e.g. https://api.clever.com/v2.1/district). \n\n\nFor detailed information on changing API versions, check out our developer documentation on Upgrading to the latest version of\nClever’s API.\n\n\n\nMAJOR VS MINOR VERSIONS\n\nWe define a minor release as one that will only add new features (e.g. response fields, input parameters, endpoints, etc) and fix\nsmall bugs. Minor versions will be backwards compatible.\n\n\nMajor version releases may contain features that are not backwards compatible as well as feature deprecations.\n \n\n\nRELEASING A NEW API VERSION\n\nClever is committed to releasing planned API versions no more than once a year, based on the following release timeline:\n \n\n * New API versions will be announced by November. \n * Rostering (data and events) API versions should be released by December. \n * Identity API changes should be released by March. \n\n\nAny delay in this timeline will be communicated to customers in advance. In case of an emergency, Clever reserves the right to\nrelease an API version outside of this schedule to meet customer needs with proactive communications to partners. \n\n\nWhen a new version is fully released, new applications will build to the newest API version, and will not be able to use any\nprevious version of the API.\n\n\n\nUPDATING VERSIONS AFTER RELEASE\n\nWhile we consider new versions code complete upon official release, we recognize that bugs can slip by our testing processes! For\nthree months after a version is released, we will make updates to the version to fix any discovered bugs. Once three months have\npassed, we will freeze the version as-is and make no further updates.\n\n\n\nGLOBAL CHANGES\n\nWe sometimes need to make changes to all API versions - if we do, we will communicate this with partners as soon as possible.\n \n\n\nDEPRECATING AN EXISTING API VERSION\n\nClever will support no more than two major API versions at a time. This policy aligns with industry best practice to ensure a\ngreat front-end experience for you and your customers. This means that when a new major version is released, we will begin the\ndeprecation and end of life process for the oldest major version.\n\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that deprecation goes smoothly for all customers. Therefore, the deprecation and end of life process\nis as follows:\n \n\n * At least one year in advance of deprecation, Clever will send notice of deprecation to all partners. We will also reach out to\n   partners who are using the API version to help determine their upgrade path and timeline.\n * Once an API version is deprecated, Clever will provide only limited support for bug fixes.\n * An API version will no longer be supported six months after it is deprecated. At this point, applications will be unable to\n   access any of the version’s endpoints.\n\n\nUpon announcement of API v3, we are officially beginning the deprecation and end of life process for API v1, which includes both\nv1.1 and v1.2. The version will be deprecated by Back to School June 2022 and no longer accessible by December 2022."

The answers to these questions will vary depending on the terms of\nyour current contract. Most contracts follow the same general structure but reach out to accounts-receivable@clever.com with any\nquestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DOES CLEVER BILL APP PARTNERS?\n\nClever bills by billable schools or users shared depending on your contract. For questions, contact support.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT COUNTS AS A BILLABLE SCHOOL?\n\nWe only charge for schools that are explicitly shared and launched.\n\nExplicitly shared: This excludes any schools that are shared via dually enrolled users. For example, student X is enrolled in\nclasses at both Clever Middle School and Clever High School. Clever Middle School is shared with your application, but Clever High\nSchool isn't. We'll provide access to both school objects via the API, but will only bill for Clever Middle School. \n\nLaunched: We only bill for launched connections, giving you time to test and get set up! Read more about setting launch dates\nhere.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE BILLING FREQUENCY FOR APP PARTNERS?\n\nPartners are billed annually upfront for the contracted annual platform fee. For partners that exceed the amount included in the\nagreement (overage), these will be billed in arrears monthly. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHEN DO I START GETTING BILLED FOR A SCHOOL OR USER?\n\nYou're billed for any schools or users shared through launched district connections on the last day of the month that haven't been\nfiltered out from within your Clever Dashboard. If a school is connected midway through the month, you will still be charged full\nprice for that school for the month.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW CAN I VIEW THE NUMBER OF BILLED SCHOOLS OR USERS?\n\nView the number of schools or users you’ll be billed for any given month on the Billing tab of your Clever dashboard.\n\nWithin the billing tab, you can select a billing period by navigating to Billing period as of.\n\n * This is updated nightly.\n * This data represents the total number of shared schools and users in launched district connections.\n * The number excludes any schools or users you’ve filtered out from within your Clever dashboard.  \n * Schools or users shared multiple times are only counted once for billing purposes.\n\nFrom the billing tab, you can:\n\n 1. Change the billing period to see what you were billed for in previous months.\n 2. Request to have a CSV emailed to you for all of the schools or users you're currently being billed for to keep for your\n    records.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT DO I DO IF A DISTRICT OVERSHARES DATA?\n\nUse the billing tab to check the number of schools each connected district shares with your application via Clever. We recommend\nlooking at the tab monthly to avoid any over-sharing issues before your monthly invoice.\n\nIf a district shares too much data, there are two ways to remedy this.\n\n 1. Reach out to the district to request that they adjust their sharing settings so that the appropriate amount of data is shared\n    with your application. If the district needs assistance, they can submit a ticket to our Support Team via the Help Center\n    form.\n 2. You can also use the application-side filtering tool to remove excess data from the API. Any schools filtered out using this\n    tool will also be removed from all future invoices. For more information on how to filter excess data, please see\n    this article: Creating filters for district data\n\nFinally, you can use our License feature to flag those districts that are oversharing so that you can check this in a programmatic\nway through your Clever dashboard. For more information on how to set up licenses for a district in your dashboard please see\nthis article: Setting Up License Usage Limits \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT TOOLS CAN I USE TO MANAGE DATA SHARING?\n\nWe have a few tools that help surface when a district shares too much data with your application. \n \n\n\nUSING LICENSING TO MONITOR SHARING\n\nThe first is the licensing feature. This feature allows you to set the number of school or student licenses a district has\npurchased for your application. If a district exceeds the number of licenses, you and the district will be notified in the Clever\ndashboard. For more information on the licensing feature, please see this article.\n\n\nAPPLYING APP-SIDE FILTERS\n\nApplications can now create filters to receive only the needed data, giving you control over data sharing and enhancing\nintegration quality. For instructions on how to set up filters, please see this article.\n\n\nRECOMMENDING SHARING PERMISSIONS \n\nSmarter data sharing allows you to recommend sharing settings to districts that are connected with your app. You can send updated\nrecommendations even after districts have enabled data sharing with you. This article covers how to send sharing recommendations\nto a district.\n\n\nMODIFYING LAUNCH DATES\n\nAs mentioned above, you are only charged for launched connections. If a district isn't ready to launch, you can modify the launch\ndate to be further into the future until they are set up to begin using the application. This will allow them to set sharing\npermissions, resolve data quality errors, and complete all their steps on the district end before you begin getting billed for the\nshared data. More information about setting launch dates can be found here: For App Partners: Managing district launch dates.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI SEE SCHOOLS SHARED WITH APPARENTLY NO TEACHERS, STUDENTS, OR SECTIONS. WHY MIGHT THIS BE HAPPENING?\n\nWe provide access to schools that aren't explicitly shared with your application for users who are associated with multiple\nschools in Clever. As a result, you might see a school with very limited teacher, section, and student data. You aren't billed for\nschools not explicitly shared with your application via Clever.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT IF THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN SCHOOL DATA IN CLEVER AND MDR DATA?\n\nYou're invoiced based on the number of unique schools shared with your application via Clever. ‘Shared schools’ is defined by the\ntotal number of unique Clever IDs available to your application via the API, not by the total number of unique MDR numbers. This\ndata doesn't always align perfectly with MDR data, depending on how the district has structured their schools in their SIS.   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNeed help?

Tips for creating an effective guide\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A TEACHER QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\nLibrary applications can create a Quickstart guide on Clever to help teachers feel confident about setting up your application.\nThis proven format generates a 10% increase in user engagement with your application.\n\n\nThe structure of this guide was developed in response to teacher feedback: the biggest barrier to using an app is finding the time\nand energy to get it set up.\n \n\n\n \n\nOnce your Quickstart Guide is published in Clever, your app detail page will show a link that teachers can access anytime, and any\nteacher that installs your app from the Library will be notified and nudged to use your guide if they have not yet logged in and\nused your application. Sometimes, teachers just need a reminder and easy steps - and Clever is here to help with that!\n \n\nTeachers can immediately launch your application from the Quickstart Guide.\n \n\n\nHOW DO I CREATE A TEACHER QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\n * Log in to Clever\n * Navigate to Library + App Store > Teacher Quickstart Guide in your left hand navigation menu\n * To begin, first input Account Syncing information. The answer is yes only if your application requires teachers to take an\n   additional action after Clever sends your app the rostering data. Example actions:\n   * Teacher is required to click a button to ‘sync’  their class from Clever. \n   * Teacher is required to upload or input their classes into the application\n * Fill out the following How to use steps. Your application must fill out a minimum of 1 step, and can fill out a max of 3 steps.\n   Note that there is a character limit per step to improve readability for teachers. \n\n \n\n\nTIPS FOR CREATING AN EFFECTIVE GUIDE\n\nA successful Quickstart Guide is one that motivates teachers to launch the application and take the simple steps involved in\nsetup. A less successful guide might contain accurate Getting Started content, but may ultimately feel too complex for teachers to\nlaunch at that moment. \n \n\nTips: \n\n 1. Avoid linking to your website’s help center articles instead of writing the essential content within Clever\n 2. If you’re uploading screenshots for each step, indicate which button(s)/sections teachers need to engage with, using arrows,\n    callout boxes, etc."

Resources in the\nLibrary can be added to a teacher’s Teacher Page for easy access by students and teachers.\n \nWhen a teacher adopts a Library application with SSO, Clever shares only the absolute minimum information: student first name,\nlast initial, grade level, and course enrollment. Clever does not share any sensitive information with Library applications,\nincluding student number, SIS ID, email, state ID, school/district information, or any demographic information about the student.\n \n\n\nHOW DO THE APP STORE AND CLEVER LIBRARY INTERACT?\n\nThe App Store is superpowered by data and insights from the Clever Library: Teachers install Clever Library apps, write reviews,\nshare with other teachers, and now, send purchase requests to their administrators. District Admins have the ability to recommend\nparticular resources to teachers, promoting them in the Library and encouraging teachers to adopt them.\n\nThe table below provides a concise overview of the ways different user types interact with the App Store and Library.\n\n \n\n \n\nDistrict Admin\n\nSchool Tech Lead\n\nTeacher\n\nAdd applications\n\n\n\nOnly Library applications\n\nPurchase applications\n\n\n\nFor associated schools\n\n\n\nOnly requests\n\nReview applications\n\n\n\nWith other teachers\n\nShare personally identifiable information\n\n\n\nFor associated schools\n\nRecommend / share \nWith other teachers"

Account recovery\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds another level of security to your account. If you enable two-factor authentication, you'll be asked\nto enter a verification code in addition to your username and password every time you log in to Clever. This extra verification\nprevents unauthorized parties from accessing your account, even if your password has been compromised.\n\nYou can set up two-factor authentication for your Clever account in two ways:\n\n * Via a text message sent to your phone or device (SMS)\n * Via the authenticator application Authy (available for iOS and Android)\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSETTING UP TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\n\n \n1. Log into your Clever Account\n\n2. Click on your name in the upper right-hand corner, and select Profile\n\n3. Scroll down to select Enable TFA\n\n4. Select how you’d like to receive verification codes, and then enter your phone number to proceed. \n \n\nPlease note: If you choose to use Authy and have not already downloaded the app, you will be prompted to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. When prompted, either enter your code from Authy or request a code via SMS.\n\n6. The next time you log in to Clever, you will be prompted to enter your verification code. Enter the verification code received\nvia Authy or SMS. You can ask Clever to remember you for 30 days on your device so that you do not need to authenticate every time\nyou log in. \n\nThis option is not recommended if you are on a public or shared computer, or don’t have password protection on your personal\ncomputer.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDISABLING TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\n\nOnce you have two-factor authentication enabled, you can disable this setting at any time from your Clever Profile page.\n\nYou’ll be prompted to enter your current Clever password to disable two-factor authentication. \n\nPlease note that you cannot disable two-factor authentication if you have lost access to your two-factor authentication method. If\nyou have lost access to your two-factor authentication due to having a new device, new phone number, or inability to receive an\nSMS message from Authy, please see the Account Recovery instructions below.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nACCOUNT RECOVERY\n\nIf you are unable to access your two-factor authentication code, it will be necessary to complete account recovery as outlined\nhere: Restoring Authy Access on a New, Lost, or Inaccessible Phone  \n \nClever Support is unable to disable two-factor authentication for your account. The account recovery must be completed by our\ntwo-factor service provider, Authy. \n\n\ntags: 2FA, MFA"

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever app team members can easily reset their passwords in case of a lost or forgotten one. This article details the process for\nresetting an app team member's password.\n\nThis only applies to app partners who log in with an email address and password. App partners who log in with Sign in with Google\nor App Dashboard SSO should reset their IDP passwords in their IDP.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPASSWORD STRENGTH\n\nClever requires a certain level of complexity to ensure a strong password and also does privacy-preserving checks.\n\nDuring account creation, password reset, and login, Clever will determine if a password is unsafe if it's been made public in an\nunrelated data breach. If an app team member’s password is determined unsafe, we require the user to select a different password.\n\nFor recommendations on selecting strong passwords, see the FAQ.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRESET PASSWORD\n\nTo reset your app team member password for Clever,\n\n 1. Visit apps.clever.com and click Forgot your password?\n 2. Enter the email address associated with your admin account, click the Captcha, and click Reset \n 3. An email will be sent with a link to reset your password. If you don't receive the email, please check your spam filter and\n    make sure no-reply@clever.com is added as a contact to your email account.\n\nQuick link: https://apps.clever.com/reset?captcha=true\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUPDATE PASSWORD\n\nIf you'd like to update your Clever password, click on your name in the top-right of the app dashboard and click Profile Settings.\nEnter your existing password and new password and then click Update to update your password.\n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\nWhen attempting to log in to Clever, why do I see a note about my password being part of a public data breach?\n\n * Clever determines that a password is unsafe if it's been made public in an unrelated data breach. We perform privacy-preserving\n   checks for passwords which have been leaked online. If an app team member password matches any of these, we require the user to\n   reset their password.\n   \n\n\nAre there recommendations for choosing a secure password?\n * Use a password management solution like 1Password to use strong/unique passwords for all logins.\n * Combine three or four random words. For example: “student-task-fish-fly”. These combinations are usually easy to remember and\n   very secure.\n    \n\n \n\nRelated articles:\n * For App Partners: Securing users\n * For App Partners: How do I enable two-factor authentication?\n * For App Partners: App Dashboard SSO"

If the district has Clever Champion engagement for this year:\n    * This lets you know that the district has some expert Clever users! This might make integrating and working with them a\n      little easier since they’ve demonstrated their Clever knowledge. \n\n \n\nFor districts with no or limited Clever Academy engagement, you can customize this email template:\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello, [district user]!\n\nAs you may know, our most successful districts are those that are well-trained. \n\nIn addition to our training materials [here], I wanted to highlight free training from our single sign-on and rostering partner,\nClever. \n\nCompleting Clever’s training can minimize login, rostering, and account access issues and ensure that you're getting the most out\nof [app name].\n\nHere are a few resources you might find helpful! \n\n * For Clever district Admin: Become a Clever Certified Champion\n\n * For School Admin: Become a Certified Clever Champion\n\n * For Teachers: Become a Certified Clever Champion\n\nYou and your district users can find other courses: on everything from troubleshooting to cybersecurity resources from\nClever.academy!\n\n \n\nThanks for everything you you do,\n\n \n\n- [Your name]\n\n[Your role]\n\n[Application name]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Viewing pending invites\n4. Setting up a District Outreach Contact email address\n5. Filtering for district statuses on the District Overview page\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article briefly overviews how to invite districts to connect with your application via Clever and how to follow up on these\nrequests. For instructions on how to approving inbound requests from districts, please see our article For App Partners: Manage\ninbound district requests. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nINVITING DISTRICTS\n\nYou can invite districts individually, or if you want to send bulk invitations (to 50 or more districts), please contact your\nApplication Success Manager. \n \n\n\nINVITING DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY USING CLEVER:\n\n1. Type in the name of the district that you want to search for.\n\n2. Click the district's name or Invite to Connect.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n3. You can see whether the district is already utilizing Clever, their sync status, and how well their data matches up against\nyour application's schema. Learn more about data compatibility here. You can also Invite a district to connect with your app.\n\n Please note: Invitations to connect through Clever are intended for districts that have already subscribed to your software\nservices.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n4. Once you click the Invite, fill out your message and the contact information. You can use the default message or edit it. You\ncan also add a primary contact at the district or school. You can include multiple contacts through the Additional Contact Emails\nfield. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n Please note: The default app launch date is set to 30 days from district acceptance. District Administrators will still be able\nto edit their sharing rules and modify data before the date, but teachers and students won't see your application until the launch\ndate has passed. You can also set a custom launch date if you wish!\n\n\n\n5. If the district is already on Clever you'll see an option to add a sharing request, requesting specific data to be shared.\n\n\n\n6. Once you send the invite, the email will automatically copy you, the district, and a member of the Clever team.\n\n7. Repeat! \n\n\n\nINVITING DISTRICTS THAT ARE NOT ON CLEVER:\n\n1. Type in the name of the district you would like to search for. If they are not on Clever, it will be tagged as \"Off Clever\"\nwhen you search for it:\n \n\n\n \n\n2. From there, you will need to fill out the following information for this district and specify a curriculum contact that will be\nnotified:\n \n\n\n\n3. The contact that you specify in this form will receive an email inviting them to connect their district through Clever so that\nthey can connect with your application. It will look something like this:\n \n\n\n \n\n4. From this email, the district or school can create a Clever account for themselves. If they create an account, a member of our\nDistrict Onboarding team will reach out to help them get set up. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVIEWING PENDING INVITES\n\nTo view and manage your existing invitations to districts, head to District Overview > Pending Invites. From there you can view\nand filter results based on the status of the invitation. Invitation statuses are either \"pending\", \"approved\", or \"rejected\". \n\nYou can even send a one-time email reminder to districts who haven't yet accepted your invite! \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSETTING UP A DISTRICT OUTREACH CONTACT EMAIL ADDRESS\n\nYou can now set a District Outreach Contact email when initiating the following communications with a district:\n\n * app invite\n * app un-invite\n * app invite reminder\n * data warning\n * district request approval\n * district request rejection\n * district disconnects\n * sync requests\n * app-side safety thresholds\n\nThis will allow you to send these communications with the name and email of your choice from any user without creating and\nmaintaining a shared email account.\n\nApplication team members with edit permissions can set a District Outreach Contact by:\n\n 1. Navigating to your Clever App Dashboard >Settings > General tab > Profile Settings > District Outreach Contact. \n\n\n\n\n \n 2. Add the name and email address of your District Outreach Contact. An example would be Onboarding Team and onboarding@app.com\n\n \n\n\n\n \n 3. Once added, you'll see a dropdown where you can set a Sender contact. This will be the contact from whom emails to districts,\n    such as app invites or sync requests, will come from. There are two options: the app-wide District Outreach Contact or you as\n    the current user.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIf no outreach contact is set, then you won’t see the dropdown, and you, as the current user, will default as the sender.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nFILTERING FOR DISTRICT STATUSES ON THE DISTRICT OVERVIEW PAGE\n\nYou can use the filters on your District Overview page to find which districts have connected with your application, the status of\ntheir setup process, their launch date, and if they’ve shared data.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a list of filters that can be used:\n\n * District name\n * District status\n   * Any\n   * Setting Up\n   * Launched \n   * Licenses Exceeded\n   * Licenses Expired\n   * Setup Wizard Complete\n * Launch date\n   * Any\n   * Next Week\n   * Overdue\n * Shared schools\n   * Any\n   * No Data Shared\n   * Data Shared\n * Starred\n   * Any\n   * Starred\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRelated articles: \n * For App Partners: Manage inbound district requests"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n1. Triaging Login Issues\n2. Logging into an IdP\n3. Issues Logging in to Clever\n4. Issues Logging in to Your Application\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\nAs mentioned in our article on For App Partners: What is single sign-on (SSO)?, SSO has many moving parts, which means many things\ncan cause logins to fail. This article will help you navigate these issues and get your users logged in quickly and efficiently!\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTRIAGING LOGIN ISSUES\n\nFirst, we’ll want to narrow down where the issue is.\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE EXACT STEPS THE USER IS TAKING TO LOG IN?\n\nAre they logging in with SSO or app-specific credentials (or are they entering credentials for one method into the other’s login\npage)? This step allows us to check the user is attempting to use Clever correctly. The correct login flows are:\n \n\n\nCLEVER PORTAL\n\n 1. Go to the Clever Portal URL for your district (https://clever.com/in/<shortname>).\n 2. Click the “Log in with <Identity Provider (IdP)>” button.\n 3. Enter in their IdP credentials.\n 4. They’ll see a loading screen with a book, followed by the Clever Portal.\n\n\nINSTANT LOGIN LINKS\n\n 1. Click on the link provided by the district.\n 2. Click the “Log in with <IdP>” button\n 3. Enter in their IdP credentials.\n 4. They’ll see a loading screen with a book, followed by your application’s page.\n\n\nLOG IN WITH CLEVER BUTTON\n\n 1. Click on the \"Log in with Clever\" Button.\n 2. Enter the name of your school in the search.\n 3. Click the “Log in with <IdP> button.”\n 4. Enter in their IdP credentials.\n 5. They’ll see a loading screen with a book, followed by your application’s page.\n\n\nARE THEY SEEING ANY ERROR MESSAGES?\n\nError messages can help determine at which login stage the issue is occurring. Clever error messages look like this:\n\n\n\nWe’ll go into specific error messages below. As part of the troubleshooting process, we recommend providing screenshots of any\nerrors.\n\n \n\n\nLOGGING INTO AN IDP\n\nIf a user is having issues logging in to their Identity provider (IdP), they should contact their district support contact. The\nuser can find the contact information on their portal login page. You can also see the contact in their SSO Settings. To see their\nsettings, click on the district in your Dashboard. The SSO info for each district will be available on the Overview page.\n\n\n\nHere are some common issues in this category:\n\n \n\n\nINCORRECT PORTAL\n\nSometimes, your Clever users, especially young students using Log in with Clever buttons, will end up at a different district's\nPortal URL and won't be able to log in. To ensure they’re using the correct Portal URL, have them check the district's name at the\ntop of the page. Does it match their district's name? If not, you can provide them with their Portal URL or have them click the\nNot your district button to try their search again.\n\n \n\n\n\nINVALID SSO LINK\n\nSSO links are great for embedding in district portals or distributing as bookmarks! However, sometimes, these URLs are incorrectly\nadded. The correct format is https://clever.com/oauth/instant-login?client_id=<your client id>&district_id=<district id>\n\n\n“NOT SUCCESSFULLY AUTHENTICATED BY YOUR IDENTITY PROVIDER”\n\nThis error occurs when the IdP sends us a code representing a login failure. Although it is relatively rare, we have noticed that\nmost cases are caused by saved/cached passwords in Google Chrome. Clearing the browser history usually resolves this issue.\n\n\nINCORRECT USERNAME / PASSWORD\n\nIf the user can't log in with their credentials, direct them to their district support contact, who should be able to help them\nget their correct credentials.\n \n\nPlease note: Clever cannot provide users with their credentials or reset passwords for users.\n\n \n\n\nISSUES LOGGING IN TO CLEVER\n\nOnce the user successfully logs into their IdP, the IdP attempts to send information to Clever and find a matching user. If we\nfind a match, we’ll log the user in. The two most common login issues are listed below. If you see something else, direct the user\nto their district support contact, who will work with Clever to resolve the issue.\n\n\nNOT AUTHORIZED\n\nSome IdPs, like Google and Canvas, require the user to allow Clever to receive identifying information such as email addresses. If\nthe user does not grant Clever access, we can't log them in. The user will need to log in again and authorize the data access.\n\n\nUNABLE TO FIND MATCHING USER\n\nThe majority of login issues stem from missing data in Clever; either the user needs to be synced with Clever, or their record\nneeds to include the identifying information needed to make a match with their IdP data.\n\nIf the IdP setup is misconfigured, this error can also occur. We recommend directing the user to their district support contact\nfor further investigation.\n\n \n\n\nISSUES LOGGING IN TO YOUR APPLICATION\n\nIf the user is able to log in to their IdP and Clever but isn’t able to log in to your application, this usually suggests that\nsomething has interrupted the OAuth2 flow.\n\nClever has provided the ability to replicate the login flow from Clever to your application in the Clever Dashboard. To recreate\nthe login error: \n\n 1. Select the district for the user.\n 2. Search for the user reporting the error.\n 3. Verify the user is shared by the district.\n 4. Click on the name of the user to load their Detail View. Select Log in as [student name] to test the connection with your app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the login to your application fails, this suggests that something has interrupted the OAuth2 flow. Here are the most common\nissues:\n\n\n\nAPP ICON MISSING / “ASK YOUR ADMINISTRATOR TO ADD THIS APP TO YOUR PORTAL”\n\nUsers can only log in to applications if their data is shared with the application. If their data isn't shared, the app icon won't\nappear in the Portal, and they will see the above error if they attempt to use an SSO link or Log in with Clever button.\n\nTo resolve the issue, have the user contact their district support contact. Their district administrators will need to share their\ndata with your application.\n\n\n\nLOGGING IN TO INCORRECT ACCOUNT\n\nIf districts have shared devices, users may find themselves logged in to the account of the user who was previously logged in.\n\n\n\nUNABLE TO LOG INTO APPLICATION\n\nIf your users are seeing an error message after clicking on your application icon or SSO link, we recommend the following steps:\n\n 1. Confirm the user’s Clever ID is in your app’s database.\n 2. Make sure the record tied to the user’s Clever ID isn't deactivated or otherwise prevented from logging in on the application\n    side.\n 3. Please reach out to Clever Support with the Clever ID of the user and a screenshot of the error message. We’re happy to help\n    investigate the login issue!"

    "content": "VIEWING DISTRICT DATA\n\nThis article describes how to find and view key details about districts that are connected to your app through Clever.\n \n\n\n \n\nOn your homepage, you’ll see a list of your districts. The tags under each district indicate whether the district is:\n \n\n * No Data Shared - the district has approved your invitation, the launch date is in the future, but the district still needs to\n   setup their sharing permissions. No action is required on the app-side unless you would like to recommend any sharing rules for\n   the district.\n * Setup Wizard Complete - the district has completed their setup (i.e. the setup wizard you created and sharing permissions) and\n   the connection is now pending the launch date. During this phase, your team has the opportunity to confirm that you're\n   receiving the data you need ahead of the launch date (i.e. when the icon will appear on user Portals and allow logins). You can\n   also choose to move the launch date up if you're ready to launch earlier.\n * Launched - this district is ready to use your app through Clever!\n * Setting Up - during this phase, teachers and students cannot see or access your application.\n * Licenses Exceeded - the district has overshared students or schools with your application and need to adjust their sharing\n   permissions.\n * Requires Review - references the data safety thresholds your team has placed (Clever Dashboard > Settings > District Setup\n   page). This tag indicates the district's data has changed significantly according to your thresholds. The changes will not sync\n   until a member of your team has had a chance to review and approve them.\n * Sync Paused - the school district has paused the data sync with your application. This temporarily disables data updates.\n\n \n\nPlease note: The licensing feature makes it easier to manage and communicate with districts about licenses, but it does not limit\nhow many students or schools can be shared.\n\n \n\nWhen you click on a district’s name, you'll see a few key details about that district. At the top of the page, you’ll find the\nfollowing information:\n \n\n\n \n\n 1. Sync Status: The icon indicates the status of the district's sync. For details on possible sync statuses, please see: District\n    Sync Statuses.\n 2. Sharing type: This indicates how a district has scoped their data for your application. Any permissions updates must be made\n    by a district administrator. Possible descriptions include:\n    * Sharing no data\n    * Sharing all data\n    * Sharing selected schools\n    * Sharing selected sections\n    * Sharing data by rules\n 3. Shared schools: This is the number of schools shared by the district. Here, you are also able to set the number of licenses\n    that you have allotted to the district. For more information on using the license feature in Clever, see Set Up License Usage\n    Limits.\n 4. Launch date: This is the date that end-users will have access to your application. Usually, this date is agreed upon by you\n    and the district, but the Launch Date in Clever is set by your team. For more information about managing launch dates,\n    reference Setting and managing launch dates.\n\nFurther down on the overview page, you will see the following 3 sections:\n \n\n * District Info\n * Sync Info\n * Instant Login Info\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDISTRICT INFO:\n\nIn this section, you can find contact information for the district administrator maintaining the Clever account, in addition to\nthe district’s Clever ID, MDR number, and OAuth token.\n\n\n\nSYNC INFO:\n\nHere, you can view which SIS and sync type (SFTP, Auto-Sync, etc.) the district is using to sync data into Clever and if the sync\nfrom Clever is paused by the school district. The last successful sync date indicates when the district has last synced fresh data\nwith Clever. If the district's syncs are configured to occur nightly or hourly, you’ll also find the predicted next sync time. \n\n\n\nINSTANT LOGIN INFO:\n\nThis section provides information on the district’s Clever Portal URL, as well as their login method into Clever. If the district\ndoes not use the Clever Portal, they can use the listed Instant Login Link to embed Clever authentication for your application\ninto a different SSO portal. (Note: the district has access to the Instant Login link for your application in their Clever\ndashboard, as well)"

Tips and best practices\n6. Editing or deleting a sharing recommendation\n\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBy configuring custom sharing recommendations for districts, applications can suggest, as closely as possible, the correct users\nand rosters you need to set up your district customers.\n \n\nWhen choosing to “share custom records”, once the recommendations have been accepted by the district, they will only share the\nrostering information that meets the specific criteria you've set. Please make sure all the data you need is included in the\nrecommendation!\n \n\nThe data shared with the application via sharing rules updates based on the data synced to Clever by the district.\n \n\n\nWHAT IS A SHARING RECOMMENDATION?\n\nA sharing recommendation is a request for specific data that you can send to a district to ensure only the data you want to\nreceive is being shared. A district administrator can review the recommendation and immediately accept (or decline) the sharing\nupdate.\n \n\nFor example, a sharing recommendation might include:\n\n * All the math classes in a particular school\n * The math classes for grades 3-6 in the district, except for in two schools\n * One specific teacher’s 11th-grade homeroom class\n\nThink of a custom recommendation as a sentence:\n\n * \"Share all sections where <a field in Clever> <is/is not/contains/does not contain> <value>”\n\n\nHOW TO RECOMMEND CUSTOM RECORD SHARING\n\nTo request a sharing update for a district, go to the district’s profile page in your dashboard and use the ‘Request sharing’\nbutton in the upper right. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Sharing tab from the district profile and select ‘Edit’.\n \n\n\n \n\nOnce you select 'Edit' to recommend sharing for a specific district, select 'Share custom records' to configure specific data\nsharing rules.\n \n\n\n \n\nFor other sharing types, see our guide to sending sharing recommendations for specific districts.\n\n\n \n\n\nCONSTRUCTING CUSTOM RECORD RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nOur interface allows you to create recommendations with the same structure as outlined in the 'What is a sharing recommendation?'\nsection above (e.g. share all sections where <a field in Clever> <is/is not/contains> <value>).\n \n\n * There are a number of 'Fields' that applications can request to either include or exclude data with the sharing recommendation.\n   Fields include teachers, sections, students, and school admins (staff)\n * We recommend adding non-school constraints first as the larger the district, the longer the school list can be!\n * The modifiers available are:\n   * Is\n   * Is not\n   * Is one of\n   * Is not one of\n   * Contains text\n   * Does not contain text\n\n\n \n\n\nTIPS AND BEST PRACTICES\n\n * You can include and/or exclude subsets of data. Data can be excluded by selecting the 'is not one of' modifier.\n * For values, you can either type in any value you’d like, or search to find and click on the value you want. Some values will\n   not be available in a dropdown as the district has not authorized an application to see them.\n   * Warning: if you are typing an option in a text field, you must click 'Add: [value]’ or else the value will not be saved\n * If you’d like to filter down a rule further, you can select the ‘+ADD' option to add new criteria. This will act as an 'and'\n   statement, rather than an 'or' statement.\n   * Example Rule with Filters: Share all sections that are located at Pineapple Elementary School AND their section grade level\n     is 1 AND the section name must contain the text 'homeroom'.  \n     \n * If you recommend sharing specific students, you will also have the option to select which of these students' subjects or\n   courses you'd like to receive. You can even choose to share no sections at all! If sections are shared, you will also receive\n   the sections' associated teacher(s).\n\n * Once you have finished creating your first rule, you can click “Add Rule” to add more sharing recommendations.\n   * When you have multiple rules, the two rules don’t interact with each other. This means if you want to build off the existing\n     rule, you'll want to add a filter to the rule itself, rather than create a new rule entirely. \n   * If a rule is a sentence, having multiple rules is a paragraph:\n     \"Share all sections where grade is one of 6, 7, 8.” Also, \"Match all staff where school is Pineapple Elementary.”  \n     \n * We highly recommend adding a message so that the district administrator can easily understand the request being made\n\nOnce you have finished creating the rules and associated filters, select ‘Next', add a message, and then 'Save' to send the\nrecommendation to the district. You can only have one open sharing recommendation for a specific district at a time. \n \n\nPlease note: A district administrator must accept your sharing recommendation in order for their sharing to be updated. They may\nalso choose to decline this recommendation. If a district has accepted a recommendation, they can still edit their sharing\nsettings at any time.\n\n\n \n\n\nEDITING OR DELETING A SHARING RECOMMENDATION\n\nIf you’d like to change or remove a sharing recommendation, you can do so by going to the district’s page and going to the Sharing\ntab. \n\n\nIf you have any questions about setting up your sharing recommendations or what you are requesting from connected districts,\nplease reach out to Clever Support!"

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. What if a district wants to add summer school rosters to Clever over the summer?\n3. FAQs\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever auto-schedules SIS \"sync pause dates\" for all districts at the end of each school year, or districts can choose to\ncustomize their own sync pause dates based on their respective school year schedule. Clever provides districts with end-of-year\nand rollover guides to help them to plan for summer and the new school year rollover. No data from the district's student\ninformation system (SIS) will be synced to Clever during a sync pause. Essentially, the data in Clever will be \"frozen in time\"\nduring the sync pause period. Depending on the district's school year dates, data will typically begin syncing again between\nAugust 1st and August 12th.\n\n * First [Pause] Day: This will be the first day the district’s sync is paused, which should coincide with the district’s last day\n   of the school year.\n * Last [Pause] Day: This will be the last day the district’s sync is paused, which should be the day before the district’s SIS\n   data is active for the new school year.\n\nWhile a district's sync is paused, Clever will not process any data, allowing the district to make rostering changes to their SIS\nwithout interrupting student or teacher access to your application(s). The prior school year's data will be \"frozen\" in Clever for\nthe duration of the district's pause, allowing the previous school year's users to continue logging into your application without\ndisruption.\n \n\n\nWHAT IF A DISTRICT WANTS TO ADD SUMMER SCHOOL ROSTERS OVER THE SUMMER?\n\nWhile pausing a sync prevents SIS-synced data from processing in a district's Clever account and, therefore, updating in their\napplications, Clever does provide the ability for Clever Admins to create custom data directly from their Clever Dashboard >\nSupport tools > Custom data page during a sync pause. This includes custom students, teachers, staff (i.e., school admins), and\nsections. Custom Data is the method we recommend to districts who would like to continue adding data to Clever during a sync\npause. \n\nFor more information, please visit: Custom Data: Overview\n\n\nFAQS\n\n\nHow can we see a district’s pause dates?\n\nCheck out a district’s modal on the District Overview page of your Clever Dashboard to view their school year and pause dates!\n\nCan districts still adjust their sharing permissions while their sync is paused?\n\nYes!\n\nWhat does it mean when a district’s sync pause ends?\n\nClever will resume the district's scheduled syncs with their student information system (SIS). Each SIS handles rollover\ndifferently, so we encourage districts to check out their SIS-specific information. Districts can learn more about school year\nrollover here. Once a district's pause has ended and the data for the new school year has synced to Clever, their sync will be\nplaced on an automatic hold, allowing Clever Admins the opportunity to review the data updates before the changes process in\nClever. Once reviewed, the district can submit a request to release the sync hold from their Clever Dashboard > Sync Report page.\nPlease note that if the changes are above a certain threshold, a ticket will then be created with Clever Support to review the\nchanges before the sync hold is officially released. This is an added security precaution to ensure massive amounts of data\nchanges do not impact connected applications until they have been thoroughly reviewed by a district's Clever Admin and Clever\nSupport. \n\nWhat should we do if we need to offer summer school access?\n\nHave the district contact Clever Support to determine the best way for them to sync summer school data with your application. \n\nWhat does it mean for a district to be syncing over the summer?\n\nClever will continue to sync their data throughout the summer for districts that opt out of using Clever's pause feature. However,\nduring this time, applications will likely see a decrease in the number of students, teachers, staff (i.e., school admins), and\nsections syncing from Clever. \n\nHow can we ensure our districts are ready for the new school year?\n\nWe encourage districts to check 3-4 things once their pause has ended to confirm they’re ready for the new school year:\n\n 1. Browse their data from their Clever Dashboard > Data browser in Clever to check that the new school year's rostering data\n    looks correct.\n 2. Review the sharing permissions for each connected application to ensure they are correct.\n 3. Review their section_ids to confirm that the ID #s for sections (the section_id field in Clever) are different after a term or\n    school year rollover. We ask districts do this because Clever 'remembers' the sections that have been deleted based on their\n    section_ids changing.\n 4. If applicable, we ask Clever Admins to review their Clever Badges to ensure they are ready for the new school year.\n\n\nRelated articles:\n\n * For District Admins: Sync Holds\n * Summer School: Sync settings\n * For District Admins: Troubleshooting Tools - How do I browse district data in Clever?\n * School Year Rollover: Overview, Preparation & Recommendations"

FAQs\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nDistricts oversharing data is a common problem for applications on Clever. To help resolve this, applications can create filters\nto receive only the data you need, giving you control over data sharing and enhancing integration quality. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DOES APP-SIDE FILTERING WORK?\n\nStep 1: Districts share data with the application.\n\nStep 2: Applications apply filters on the district data to manage exactly which data they are receiving, whereby ensuring that\nonly relevant data is synced.\n\n\n  Please note: if new schools are added to a district's sync or additional data needs to be shared, it will be necessary to update\nthe app-side filters to allow this data to be accessible to you (the application).\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW DO I FILTER DISTRICT DATA?\n\nFiltering is located on the District Profile page.\n\n 1. Click Create a filter\n 2. Determine if you would like to filter by school or more granular data using sharing rules (such as grade level, subject, etc.)\n 3. Select the data that should be included in the sync. If using sharing rules to select more granular data, see the Tips and\n    best practices section below. When done, click Next\n 4. Preview data. If correct, click Save\n 5. Clever will apply the filter to the district's data. The results are displayed under Final Data once it's done processing.\n    Filters can take up to 24 hours to apply, depending on the size of the district data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIPS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR SHARING RULES\n\nIf you select Our data agreement requires more granular data sharing in step two of the data filter setup, you'll select the data\nyour app needs using sharing rules. Sharing rules allow you to select specific data using rules, such as all students in a given\ngrade, subject, course name, etc.\n\n\nAn example of an App Filter set up using sharing rules. \n\nHere are some tips when using sharing rules:\n\n * You can include and/or exclude subsets of data. Data can be excluded by selecting the is not one of modifier.\n * For values, you can either type in any value you’d like, or use it as a search bar to find and click on the value you want.\n   Some values will not be available in a dropdown as the district has not authorized an application to see them.\n * If you’d like to filter down a rule further, you can select the + AND option to add new criteria. This will act as an\n   \"and\" statement, rather than an \"or\" statement.\n   * Example Rule with Filters: Share all sections located at Pineapple Elementary School AND their section grade level is 1 AND\n     the section name must contain the text \"homeroom\".\n * Once you have finished creating your first rule, you can click Add Rule to add more rules.\n * When you have multiple rules, the two rules don’t interact with each other. This means if you want to build off the existing\n   rule, you'll want to add a filter to the rule itself, rather than create a new rule entirely. See the example below that shows\n   two separate rules:\n   * \"Share all sections where grade is one of 6, 7, 8.”\n   * Also, \"Match all staff where school is Pineapple Elementary.”\n\nPlease note: Only one filter can be placed per school. If you need to further filter data for a school, please contact Clever\nSupport, and our team will work with the district to adjust the initial data being shared to meet your specifications. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT DO DISTRICTS SEE WHEN DATA IS FILTERED?\n\nIf an app-side filter is applied to a district, they will see an App Filters tab in the application area of the Clever Dashboard.\nHere they can view:\n\n * Shared Data: the data shared with the application by the district.\n * Filters: the filters that were applied to the district data by the application.\n * Application Receives: the resulting filtered data that will be synced by the application. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFAQS\n\nWhy is Clever unable to display a preview of allowed records?\n\n\n \n\n * Clever may be unable to provide a preview of allowed records for districts with large data sets or highly complex rules. When\n   this occurs, Unable to display count of allowed records or Sorry, there is too much data… may display. However, you may still\n   safely save your app filters, and they will be applied as intended.\n\nCan I filter data for a district if they have app sync pause enabled?\n\n * Yes! You can still filter data even if they have paused their sync to your app."

District Admins can assign certain users the School\nTech Lead role, which provides them with a set of specific permissions in Clever for their associated school(s). \n \n\nFor instructions on how a district admin can assign a staff member to the School Tech Lead Role, please see Clever Roles: School\nTech Lead\n \n\nThese permissions are designed to empower this user in their role as an edtech coach, instructional technology specialist, digital\nlearning specialist, etc. Users with School Tech Lead permissions are often the individuals at a school who evaluate, roll out,\nsupport, and troubleshoot technology. \n \n\nSchool Tech Leads play an important role in helping teachers and students access your application through Clever. Continue reading\nto learn more about their permissions and how you can collaborate with them to drive engagement for your application. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSCHOOL TECH LEAD TOOLS AND PERMISSIONS\n\nIn the past, School Tech Leads only had limited admin permissions. In July 2020, Clever launched a new and improved user\nexperience to empower School Tech Leads. They have the following tools in Clever: \n \n\nHelp districts roll out edtech\n\n * Personalizing school portals\n * Creating custom sections\n * Monitoring edtech usage \n\nHelp train teachers and students\n\n * Become a certified Clever Trainer\n * Access all new Clever Academy training for School Tech Leads\n\nQuickly resolve issues with new troubleshooting tools\n\n * Temporarily access a teacher’s portal\n * Troubleshoot logins to quickly diagnose the root cause of access issues\n\nEvaluate edtech apps in the Clever App Store\n\n * Discover free SSO edtech apps in the Clever App Store \n   \n   \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW SCHOOL TECH LEADS INTERACT WITH YOUR APPS\n\nSchool Tech Leads (STLs) play an important role in helping teachers and students access your application through Clever. There are\nthree ways a School Tech Lead might interact with your application:\n \n\n 1. SSO into your application: If you have shared data with the staff user role for School Tech Leads.\n 2. Viewing your application in the school’s portal: When customizing the school’s portal, an STL can view any applications the\n    district has shared with that school."

This is not guaranteed, as the district could change its sync pattern or miss a sync. Other districts sync data in an\nirregular pattern, and in those cases, we cannot predict the next sync.\n\nUnderstanding a bit about the different sync types provides clarity on a district's sync frequency as well.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSYNC TYPES\n\n\nAUTO SYNC\n\nAn Auto Sync with Clever involves a basic initial setup. It requires minimal IT support from a district, as Clever syncs directly\nwith the district's SIS to securely transfer student roster data. These auto syncs typically run every two to three hours,\nalthough some districts are set to sync daily (per their request).\n\n\n\nSFTP SYNC\n\nA Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) Sync allows school districts to “push” data to Clever. Districts generate .csv files in a\nClever-specific CSV format and submit them to Clever using SFTP. Many districts automate the export of their files sent to an FTP\nclient daily, but SFTP Syncs are more challenging to predict, as the district pushes the data to Clever.\n \n\n For additional details on sync types, please see this article, which helps district admins choose which sync type is right for\nthem."

Privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will go over how to convert your existing district customer accounts to Clever user accounts and includes information\non our Matchmaker tool, as well as CSV file formatting and guidelines.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATCHMAKER\n\nWhen converting your existing district customers to Clever user accounts, you'll need to match your existing records to records in\nClever. Doing this preserves historical data and ensures that records are not deleted and then re-created.\n\nClever's Matchmaker is a tool that takes records from your application and matches them with records in Clever. You can access\nMatchmaker by logging into your Clever dashboard and clicking Matchmaker on the left menu bar. \n\n\n\n \n\nPlease note: Matchmaker is currently only enabled for applications that support Secure Sync since it requires access to full\ndistrict records.  \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n 1. A district authorizes your application through Clever and shares records.\n 2. You upload a CSV with your existing student, teacher, admin, school, or section/enrollment records.\n 3. Clever's Matchmaker matches the records you uploaded with the records shared with your application in Clever.\n 4. Clever emails you a CSV with a list of both matched records and a list of unmatched records.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINPUT CSV GUIDELINES\n\nWhen creating an input CSV to upload to Clever's Matchmaker, follow the guidelines below to help produce accurate matches. Use\nthis example CSV  as a guide.\n\n * It must be a valid CSV file (in accordance with RFC 4180)—that means:\n   * Every row should have the same number of columns, separated by commas\n   * Any values with commas in them should be surrounded by a matching set of quotes\n * It must contain a column header for each field\n * It should contain as many fields as possible—the more information you provide about each record, the better chance it will have\n   of being matched\n * It must contain a unique internal identifier for each record—you should use this identifier to associate matched records with\n   the original accounts in your application\n * It should contain exactly one record for each user—if a user has multiple accounts in your application, please choose one to\n   match with Clever since duplicate records will not be matched\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOUTPUT CSV FORMAT\n\nClever's Matchmaker outputs a CSV containing all of the fields from your input CSV, including additional identifying fields from\nClever:\n \n\n * Column headers for your input fields will begin with app (e.g. app.email)\n * Column headers for Clever fields will begin with clever (e.g. clever.id)\n * The matchmaker_results column will contain a string telling you whether or not the record was matched. There are five possible\n   values for this column:\n   * match: The record was matched\n   * from app, no match: The record from your application could not be matched to any record in Clever\n   * from app, duplicate: The record from your application was a duplicate of another record in your application. To match these\n     records, we recommend you pick one record to serve as the representative for all groups of duplicate records, remove the\n     rest, and re-run Matchmaker.\n   * from Clever, no match: The record in Clever could not be matched to any record from your application\n   * from Clever, duplicate: The record from Clever was a duplicate of another record from Clever. To match these records, you may\n     need to work with the district and Clever Support to clean up their data.\n\nOnce you receive your matching output, you can associate the matched records in your application with the corresponding Clever ID\n(found in the clever.id column).\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRIVACY\n\nMatchmaker will only match application records against district records that have been shared with your application in Clever.\nMatchmaker input and output CSVs are purged from Clever's system 30 days after upload.\n \n\nIf you have further questions about Clever's Matchmaker, please submit a ticket to our support team."

This article will go over how to use the Data\nBrowser and its' features, including viewing data using Clever’s v2 API or v3 API.\n\nPlease note: This feature is only available for applications with a Secure Sync integration.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSEARCHING DISTRICT DATA\n\nFrom the district's profile in your Clever dashboard, you can use the search bar at the top of the page to find any record that\nthe district is currently sharing with your application:\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSING THE DATA BROWSER\n\nAnother way to view the district's data in Clever is by clicking the Data Browser in the left-hand sidebar.\n\n\n\nHere, you can browse the district's data by record type, and use the Add Filter button to narrow down your results. You can also\nclick on each record to view a full list of the fields that the district is sharing for the record.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN V2 & V3 API\n\nClever now offers access to the v3 API as well as v2. These are some updates to note:\n\n * Version Switcher\n   * The Version Switcher allows apps to toggle between the v2 and v3 Clever APIs, thus better understanding how Clever's API\n     works, which can benefit app developers.\n   * For applications that have access to the v3 API, they’ll see a label on the top right indicating what version they're on and\n     that they can switch to the other version. \n   * Clicking on this button will open a new tab with the different version of the data browser and preserve all other states,\n     such as any current collection being viewed as well as any filters currently applied.\n * Data updates\n   * While the v3 API contains similar information to v2, the data browser will now display additional record fields when clicking\n     any record in any collection. When viewing v3 data for a user type, the ID field refers to the v3 user ID which is used for\n     identifying users with multiple roles. Any similarly named or ambiguous fields related to v2 data are prefixed with legacy_,\n     such as legacy_id on a teacher record. \n   * In the Detail view, you'll see both the ID field for a specific teacher, representing their user Clever ID, their v2 Clever\n     ID, and their sis_id.\n\nIf you want to know more about the differences between v2 and v3, please take a look at our API documentation:\nhttps://dev.clever.com/docs/new-in-api-v3\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDOWNLOADING DATA SHARED BY A DISTRICT\n\nFrom the Data Browser, you can also download the data the district has shared with your application. This feature can come in\nhandy if your team would like to manipulate the district's data, or perform a manual matching of existing accounts for your\napplication.\n \n\nTo use this feature, navigate to the record type you'd like to download information for (e.g. schools, students, teachers,\nsections, etc.), and click the 'Download' button:\n \n\n\n\nThe export will include all data that the district has shared for the record type you've selected and is also based on API type.\nFor example, if downloading a list of student records in the v3 data browser, they will have both user and legacy IDs, whereas\ndownloading from v2 will only contain relevant v2 API data. Any filters applied to view data in the Data Browser tab will not be\nreflected in the final data export.\n\nAfter clicking the Download button, a warning will appear to notify you that the CSV file being exported may contain PII. Please\nkeep in mind that files containing sensitive student information must be treated carefully."

If a district accepts your recommendation, the recommended sharing settings will replace any current sharing rules\nthat the district has configured for your application. After accepting, the district can still update its sharing settings at any\ntime.\n\n\nThis article covers how to send sharing recommendations to a district. To view the district experience, see our district admin\nguide for sharing recommendations.\n\n \n\n\nHOW TO SET RECOMMENDED SHARING FOR A DISTRICT\n\nTo request a sharing update from a district, go to the district’s profile page in your dashboard and use the ‘Request sharing’\nbutton in the upper right. Alternatively, you can navigate to the 'Sharing' tab from the district profile and select ‘Edit’.\n \n\n\n\n\nThis will open a setup guide that will walk you through the following steps to recommend sharing rules for a district:\n\n1. Choosing a sharing type:\n\n * You can recommend that districts:\n * Share all records in the district\n * Share all records in specific schools\n * Share custom records\n * You can also\n * Edit an existing recommendation if you’ve already sent one to the district\n * Import the district’s current sharing setting and recommend changes\n    \n\n\n\n2. Setting customized recommendations\n\n * If you choose to recommend sharing all records in the district, you’ll skip this step.\n * If you select ‘Share all records in specific schools’, you can select which schools should be shared. \n\n * If you select ‘Share custom records’, you can configure custom sharing rules for the district. For an in-depth guide to\n   configuring sharing rules, see this guide.\n\n\n\n3. Preview and save\n\n * On this step, preview the sharing settings you configured in the earlier steps of the guide.\n * Add a message for the district that will appear in their dashboard when they review your recommended sharing settings.\n\n\nOnce you save your sharing recommendation, the district will receive a notification via email as well as within the Clever\nDashboard. To view the district experience, you can reference this district-facing article."

Districts control the data that is shared with your app by\nsetting up data sharing rules and data access.\n\n\nThere are two potential reasons that district data is missing from your app dashboard:\n \n\n1. The district has not shared the data with your application. Check the Sharing Rules to make sure that the data-sharing rules\nare configured correctly.\n \n\n\n\n2. The district's data has not made it from their SIS into Clever. You can pass along or view these SIS-specific articles for\ntroubleshooting steps based on SIS-type. If the district doesn't see the data in their own data browser, something specific to the\nSIS sync is likely keeping the data out of Clever:\n \n\n * Aeries\n * Illuminate\n * Infinite Campus Auto Sync\n * Infinite Campus API Sync\n * PowerSchool\n * SchoolInsight Auto Sync\n * Skyward Auto Sync\n * Skyward API Sync\n * SFTP\n\n\n\nINCORRECT DATA\n\nIf data is incorrect, Clever might be pulling the field (e.g. Course_name) from the wrong field within the district's SIS.\nFor most SIS Auto Syncs, Clever can customize the fields that we pull data from, or filter out unnecessary data.\n\nReach out to Clever support so that we can get that all set up!"

If you you leave this blank, the default is 30 days after the district accepts the invitation.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMANAGING LAUNCH DATES\n\nYou can manage, set, and reschedule launch dates for districts by navigating to your app dashboard's District Overview page and\nsearching for the district you need to update. Click on their hyperlinked name to open the district's overview page.\n\n\nThen click on the pencil icon to the right of the existing launch date.\n \n\n\n\nFrom there you can select an updated date to Re-schedule or choose Launch Now if you want the district to go live immediately:\n\n\n\nPrior to the launch date, the connection status will show as “Setting Up.” This means that you are able to see the data that the\ndistrict has shared with you, but district users cannot yet view or access your application from their Clever Portal. During the\n“Setting Up” stage, no action is required, but the district admin can use the time to make sure they are sharing the correct data\nwith you and check that they are not hitting any data warnings or errors.\n\nYou are able to modify a launch date up to the date of the launch.

This\nincludes setting up recommended data sharing permissions for your districts. As a best practice, we recommend configuring these\nsettings before inviting districts to your application; however, these settings can also be updated at any time in the future. \n\nPlease visit this article for instructions on how to invite districts to your application in Clever here: For App Partners:\nInviting & connecting districts to your app\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDISTRICT DATA SHARING\n\nTo access your District Setup page to modify the settings detailed in this article, please: \n\n * Navigate to your Clever Dashboard > Settings page.\n * Select the District Setup tab.\n\nThe District Setup tab includes the following options:\n\n * Globally Recommended Sharing: This feature allows application partners to configure recommended data sharing permissions so\n   districts will share the correct data with your application. Essentially, you are providing your districts with\n   data-sharing best practices when connecting with your application for the first time. \n   \n   * Please visit the District Experience section of this article for details about the different options available for districts\n     when sharing their data with your application. The information in the District Experience section will help you to provide\n     the appropriate recommend sharing permissions. For detailed setup instructions, see our guide to global recommended sharing\n     settings.\n * Custom setup wizard: This feature allows you to add a custom message which will display for district admins in Clever who are\n   adding your application for the first time and have configured their data sharing. We recommend using this feature to inform\n   district admins about additional setup steps for successfully launching your application, providing them with other specifics\n   they might need, or just letting them know you'll be in touch! Utilizing this feature to inform district admins will help\n   mitigate potential challenges for districts that are setting up your application in Clever. Once you've saved your updates, you\n   will have the option to preview your changes.\n   \n * Enable safety thresholds: This feature helps to ensure that significant data changes from a district (e.g., updating their\n   sharing permissions for your application) will place the next application sync on an automatic hold before processing the\n   data, giving your team time to review the changes before they update your application. For detailed instructions, see our guide\n   to safety thresholds.\n * Request API V3 Migration CSVs: This option will map the legacy \"role-based\" Clever IDs to the more recent API v3.0 User IDs.\n   When choosing this option, a zip file containing one CSV for every one of your connected districts will be provided for\n   download for one week after being created. In the rare case that a district mapping cannot be completed, there will be an error\n   file created documenting this information.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDISTRICT SHARING EXPERIENCE\n\nWhen a district either requests your application or is sent an invite by you, they have the option to create \"sharing permissions\"\nto determine what district data they want synced to your application. \n\nDistrict admins can configure application sharing permission in any one of the following ways:\n\n * Share by District: All district data in Clever will be synced to the application, including district admins, schools, teachers,\n   students, staff, sections, and enrollments.  \n * Share by Schools: Clever will only share any data associated with the schools the district has selected for your application.\n * Share by Rules: Clever will only share data that meets the specific criteria the district sets. This is the most recommended\n   sharing type as it provides districts with the most flexibility in specifically determining what data should be included, or\n   excluded, in the sharing. Read this article to learn more about how to Share by Rules! \n * School Site Sharing: If the district has designated School Tech Leads in Clever, a district admin can provide them with the\n   ability to configure application sharing permissions for their associated schools. More info here!\n * Copy Sharing: Clever will copy the sharing permissions from another application that has already been set up."

This makes it easier for teachers to get started in your product, because\ntheir account and their students’ accounts are set up automatically, without requiring the teacher to hand-enter the information.\nApplications added by teachers this way through Clever also show up automatically as SSO resources in the Clever Portal for the\nteacher and their students.\n \n\nCurrently, only teachers in districts that have already set up a district-level account with Clever can use Sign Up with Clever;\nnew teachers who attempt to Sign Up with Clever are directed to have their district IT administrators set up a connection with\nClever.\n\n \n\n\nHOW \"SIGN UP WITH CLEVER\" WORKS FOR TEACHERS\n\nIf your application supports Sign Up with Clever, teachers can create an account in your product either via a “Sign Up with\nClever” button on your website, or via your product’s listing on the Clever Library:\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nTeachers will then be presented with a screen to confirm that they would like to share their profile information to create\naccounts in your product for themselves and their students. Teachers may also take this opportunity to review your application’s\nterms of service and privacy policy.\n \n\n\n \n\nAfter confirming their approval, the teacher will be taken to your product to complete their onboarding and start using your\nproduct.\n \n\nImmediately upon signup, a Single Sign-On (SSO) link to your product will also appear on the Clever Portal for the teacher and all\nof his or her students. Specifically, the link will appear on the teacher’s Class Page, to distinguish it from resources that are\nmanaged at the district level.\n \n\nAfter signing up, a teacher may log in to their account in your product either through the SSO link on their Clever Portal.\nAlternatively, if you have a Log In with Clever button on your site, they can go to your site directly to log in.\n\n \n\n\nHOW \"SIGN UP WITH CLEVER\" WORKS FOR STUDENTS\n\nOnce a teacher has used Sign Up with Clever to create an account for themselves and their students, the teacher’s students may log\nin either via the SSO link on their teacher’s Class Page, or by going to you site directly and clicking “Log in with Clever”.\n \n\nIn the typical case, students should not need to create their own accounts, as your product should provision student accounts\nautomatically when teachers sign up.\n \n\nAny new student who joins a teacher’s class will automatically have any SSO links added to their portal, and your application\nshould provision an account for the student the next time they or their teacher logs in.\n \n\nPlease note: Currently, teachers are the only ones who can sign up for and authorize new applications. Students cannot use Sign Up\nwith Clever to create accounts in applications themselves.\n\n \n\n\nHOW \"SIGN UP WITH CLEVER\" WORKS FOR ADMINISTRATORS\n\nSchool and district administrators can see an overview of the applications that their teachers and students are using.\nAdministrators can see not only the total number of teacher signups, but also the number of 7-day active students and teachers. In\nthis way, administrators can easily learn about new resources that are popular with their teachers, and reach our directly if they\nwould like to engage more deeply with the provider.\n \n\n\n\nCurrently, School and district administrators cannot sign up for applications using Clever. In rare cases, a district\nadministrator may disable their teacher’s access to use “Sign Up with Clever” functionality, in which case teachers see a message\ninstructing them to sign up for your application and create student accounts by hand.\n\n \n\n\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN TEACHER SIGN-UPS AND DISTRICT CONNECTIONS\n\nHistorically, only district administrators have been able to set up new SSO and rostering connections with your application.\nTeacher sign-ups are similar to district connections in many ways: they both facilitate the automatic creation of accounts, they\nboth support Single Sign-on, and they both provide your application a single, consistent view of the district’s SIS data.\n \n\nThe primary difference between teacher sign-ups and district connections is who manages the connection: for teacher sign-ups, each\nteacher individually decides whether to use your application, and can add or remove access at any time. For district connections,\nan authorized Clever Admin at the district level must authorize the connection with your application, and sets up Sharing\nPermissions to designate en-masse which students and teachers need access.\n \n\nThe other difference is the data that is available to your application. For teacher sign-ups, your application has access to only\nthe minimum information needed to provision accounts: namely, teacher name and email, the sections they teach, and the name and\ngrade for their students, along with corresponding Clever IDs for all user and section records. You do not receive information\nsuch as school or district name, student date-of-birth, student email, or student id numbers. In contrast, district connections\nauthorize the sharing of the full Clever Data Model. In addition, data from teacher sign-ups can only be accessed on login; unlike\ndistrict connections, teacher sign-ups do no not support overnight data syncing.\n \n\nOn your application dashboard, teacher sign-ups are not associated with any district, but you can diagnose issues by searching for\nstudents and teachers by name. See the Sign Up with Clever troubleshooting guide for more details.\n\n \n\n\nHOW TO TRACK USAGE OF \"SIGN UP WITH CLEVER\"\n\nVisit your analytics page to see the total number of students and teachers who are using your application. You can use the\n“Source” filter to identify the usage coming from teacher sign-ups, district connections, or both."

Accessing extension fields\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIf a district needs to send data fields outside of the standard fields listed in Clever's SFTP Specifications, they can do so by\nuploading extension fields. \n\nDistrict admins can add custom fields for the following data types:\n•    Schools\n•    Sections\n•    Students\n•    Teachers\n•    Staff\n\nWe do not accept custom fields for enrollments or student contacts.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSYNCING EXTENSION FIELDS TO CLEVER\n\nA district can upload extension fields in two ways: \n\n1. Manual upload via the Clever Dashboard: Support Tools > Custom Data page.\n2. Automatic upload through the district's current student information system (SIS) sync.\n\nDirections for districts that would like to add extension fields can be found here.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nACCESSING EXTENSION FIELDS\n\nExtension field data is available for v2.1 and higher. These fields will appear on the associated record as an extension field.\n\nFull documentation for supporting extension fields can be found in our Dev Docs. \n \n\n\nUPDATE YOUR APPLICATION SETTINGS\n\nIn order to receive extension fields, you'll need to add the fields to the list of fields you will accept in your Data Access\nsettings (Settings > Data Access). You'll need to mark the ext field as optional for any record types you'll support.\n\nAdditionally, a district will need enable access to extension fields from their Clever Dashboard under the Settings > Field Access\nfor your application. Once the district has enabled access, the data will be available to your application in the Clever API. \n\n\n\nFIELD NORMALIZATION\n\nBecause fields are created and populated by the district outside of our schema, we cannot normalize the data within the field.\nAdditionally, there are no constraints on what districts can use for field name(s).\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n \n\nRelated Articles: \n\nFor District Admins: Syncing custom (i.e., extension) fields to Clever"

The feature helps districts\naudit the fields each of their connected applications ingests and ensures you and our other application partners only receive and\nsync data relevant to your integration. Only application partners with the Rostering (Secure Sync) integration should expect to\nsee the \"Data Access\" settings in their App Dashboard. Learn more about app integration options with Clever here. \n \n\n If your app requires fields outside of Clever's API, you can have them upload them as extension fields. Learn more here.\n\n \n\nData access is broken into two categories for sensitive records types:\n \n\n * Required: Fields that are marked as required must be sent by the district to your application\n * Optional: Districts can select which optional fields they want to send to your application\n\n\nFor non-sensitive record types please select all fields that your application can ingest. Districts cannot opt out of sending\nthese fields if they are included from their SIS to Clever. \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTING UP DATA ACCESS\n\nStart with your developer application! By setting and testing changes on your developer application, you can avoid any disruptions\nfor your end users.\n \n\n1. Navigate to the Data Access tab under Application Settings. Here, you’ll see separate modules for each data type, with the\noption to edit both required and optional fields for sensitive data types and non-sensitive data types. \n\n\n\n2. Click Edit Required or Edit Optional (only available for student-related collections) to adjust the data access settings for\nyour application. On the left hand side, you’ll see all fields available for the specific data type. Click on a field name to move\nit over to the Required field list. Fields under Required fields are made available to your application via the API. Fields saved\nunder Available fields will no longer be available for your application once saved. You will be able to come back to this page and\nadd those fields at a later date if you need them.\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease Note:\n- A field can be marked as either required or optional, but not both.\n- Fields that are greyed out under ‘Required fields’ are required by Clever to be made available to every application.\n- If you don’t utilize an entire record type (ex. Student contacts), simply click the Disable [data type] option for the specific\ndata type. \n\n\n3. Click Save and repeat for other data types.\n\n4. Test the settings with your developer application and sandbox district before adjusting them in your production application.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\n\n \n\n\nHOW IS DATA ACCESS DIFFERENT FROM DATA VALIDATION?\n\n * Data access changes the fields that are available to your application via Clever’s API.\n   * Example: Student DOB is not marked as a required or optional field in your dashboard, so it won’t be available to your\n     application via the API even if the district includes it in their feed to Clever from their SIS.\n * Data validation is a way to check that the data available to your application meets the requirements of your integration.\n   * Example: Student number must be unique within a district. Please read \"What are Data Warnings?\" for more information on data\n     validation.\n\n\n\nCAN I ADJUST FIELD REQUIREMENTS ON A DISTRICT-BY-DISTRICT BASIS?\n\n * No. The field requirements set in your dashboard apply to all connected districts. Districts can select which optional fields\n   they make available to your application via Clever, so the fields available to you via the API may differ slightly from\n   district to district.\n\n\n\nHOW ARE DISTRICTS NOTIFIED OF CHANGES TO FIELD REQUIREMENTS?\n\n * Districts will receive a notification within their Clever dashboard if you make any updates to the required or optional fields\n   once the connection is launched.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENSITIVE COLLECTIONS AND NON-SENSITIVE COLLECTIONS?\n\n * Sensitive collections are data that pertains directly to students (student + student contacts). Districts have more autonomy to\n   exclude or include fields for these collections on a per app basis. \n\n\n\nSOME OF MY FIELDS ARE MISSING, HOW CAN I GET THEM?\n\n * If your application requires ell_status, iep_status, or frl_status let us know and we'll be happy to add those fields for you!\n\n\n\nWHAT IF I WANT SOME OF THIS DATA IN THE FUTURE?\n\n * These settings will be available for you in your dashboard. If your application requires a piece of data in the future you'll\n   simply be able to navigate here and add it. For the majority of districts, that data field will be available upon next sync."

    "content": "This article contains the following:\n1. Overview\n2. What are safety thresholds?\n3. How to enable safety thresholds\n4.How to customize safety thresholds\n5. How to approve districts that require a review\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen a district’s student information system (SIS) syncs to Clever or the district makes a change to their sharing permissions\nwith your application, this can result in significant changes to the rostering data available in Clever’s API for this district.\n\nIf you enable safety thresholds, Clever will check to see if there are major data changes every time a district syncs or changes\ntheir sharing settings, If there are large changes, we’ll prevent district data from being updated in Clever’s API until the\nchanges are reviewed and approved by your team.\n\nEnabling safety thresholds is an important part of syncing rostering information for a district as it ensures that your app team\nis aware of any potentially significant changes to a district’s data. Safety thresholds are a safeguard to prevent potentially\nincorrect or undesired changes from being synced to your application.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE SAFETY THRESHOLDS?\n\nIf a district’s most recent sync or an update in their sharing permissions results in significant changes, a safety hold will be\ntriggered. The district will go into the ‘Requires Review’ state. Data for that district will not be updated in Clever until the\nchanges are either reverted by the district or approved by a member of your team.\n\nPlease note: Only application team members with the Admin role in Clever will receive and will be able to approve Safety Threshold\nnotifications\n\n \nClever will send a daily digest of any districts that are 'awaiting review' to users who have subscribed to emails about sharing\nchanges and connected districts.\n \nSyncs requiring a review will need to be manually approved on a per district basis for these changes to be synced, which can be\ndone in the district profile page, Sync Status tab.\n \nOnce a safety hold is approved, the district’s data will be fully available in Clever’s API.\n \n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW TO ENABLE SAFETY THRESHOLDS\n\nTo enable safety thresholds, navigate to Settings > District Setup tab in the dashboard.\n\nOnce safety thresholds are enabled, Clever will begin checking for major changes any time a district syncs or changes their\nsharing settings. You can enable or disable this setting at any time, but if there are districts that are awaiting review when you\ndisable the feature, their data will not be updated until their next sync or sharing change.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW TO CUSTOMIZE SAFETY THRESHOLDS\n\nBy default, a district will enter the ‘Requires Review’ state if:\n\n * Over 75% of any data type (e.g. schools, students, teachers, sections) being updated\n * Over 10% of any data type (e.g. schools, students, teachers, sections) being deleted\n\nYou might find that these thresholds don’t quite meet your needs -- and if so, you can easily change them in Settings > District\nSetup. Here, you can change the percentages of updates and deletes that will trigger a safety threshold. Additionally, you can\nchoose whether you would like creation events to also send a district to the \"Requires Review\" state.\n\nIf you leave any box unchecked, we'll ignore that type of data change (such as data creations or deletions). So, for instance, if\nyou leave the creations box unchecked for Teachers, we'll ignore any data creations for teachers.\n \n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHOW TO APPROVE DISTRICTS THAT REQUIRE A REVIEW\n\nWhen you log into your dashboard, we’ll let you know if there are any districts that are awaiting review. You can click on this\nalert or filter for districts where Sync Status is ‘Requires Review’ to see all districts that have major data changes. \n \n\n \n\nOnce you click into a district’s profile, you will see an alert that the district has major data changes that require your team’s\nreview. You can click on this alert or on the 'Sync Status' tab to view the changes. \n\n \n\nIf the changes look good - they’re expected, or won’t cause major issues - you can click the ‘Approve changes’ button. Once the\nchanges are approved, Clever will process the latest data changes and update the API accordingly. \n\nIf you’re not sure if the changes are intentional or if the changes could cause major issues, you can use the ‘Email district’\nlink to reach out to the district’s team. \n\nIf the approval button is greyed out, please reach out the district and ask they push another sync with Clever. The following\nmessage will show in when you attempt to click the greyed-out button if the data from the district is stale: \"The district's data\nis out of date - please reach out to the district and have them re-sync with Clever.\"\n \n\nPlease note: While a district has the status of ‘Requires Review', no changes will be processed unless the district reverts\nchanges or you approve them."

Application requirements\n6. Frequently Asked Questions\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article is to provide our application partners with information on the sync or SIS ID conversion process for districts and\nschools.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS A SYNC OR SIS ID CONVERSION?\n\nA sync conversion is when schools change their way of syncing their data to Clever. This means they have either:\n\n * Changed their sync type (e.g. going from a manual SFTP sync to a Clever-managed auto sync)\n * Changed their Student Information System (SIS) (e.g. going from Infinite Campus to PowerSchool)\n\nAn SIS ID conversion is when schools keep the same syncing system but need to change their users’ SIS IDs. \n\nBoth of these require Clever go through the conversion process to preserve the Clever IDs for users.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT IS THE CLEVER ID VS THE SIS ID?\n\nThe primary identifiers for records in Clever are known as SIS IDs. The following fields are SIS IDs:\n \n\nData typeColumn Header/Field NameNotesSchoolSchool_idTypically the school local id. Used in all other files. Corresponds to ’sis\nid’ field in Clever. Must be unique across the district.StudentStudent_idUnique and constant id for student, may be student\nnumber, state id, or other unique identifier, to be used in enrollments.csv upload. Corresponds to ’sis id’ field in Clever. Must\nbe unique across the district.TeacherTeacher_idUnique and constant id for teacher, may be teacher number, state id, or other\nunique identifier, to be used in sections.csv upload. Corresponds to ’sis id’ field in Clever. Must be unique across the\ndistrict.SectionsSection_idUnique and constant id for section, to be used in enrollments.csv upload. Corresponds to ’sis id’ field\nin Clever. Must be unique across the districtStaffStaff_idAn identifier provided by the district when syncing or creating this\nstaff member. Must be unique across the district.Contacts  Contact_sis_idThe unique identifier for this contact, if one exists\n\n\nClever ID refers to the globally unique identifier that's assigned to a record in Clever. This ID is based on the SIS ID. If the\nSIS ID changes, the Clever ID will change. If schools change their SIS IDs, this causes the users' accounts to be deleted and will\ngenerate new accounts. This can cause the loss of historic data in connected applications as most apps use the Clever ID as the\nidentifier to create accounts.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW CLEVER PRESERVES THE USER ACCOUNTS\n\nWhen schools reach out about starting either conversion process, we enable protection settings on their account to ensure teachers\nand students are minimally affected by the changes in data.  During this time, all syncing of data between the district and Clever\nwill be paused, however, users will still be able to access Clever and their applications.\n\nWe can then work with the district to make sure that their data is error-free and use our matchmaker tool to ensure that the new\nsis_ids are associated with the old sis_ids for each user, thus preserving the Clever IDs for each user. This process can take up\nto 3 weeks during peak times for various reasons such as troubleshooting sync errors, the need to notify applications for any\nreason, cleaning up data, etc. The schools’ role in the conversion is to supply accurate, error-free data. Schools should not\nreuse SIS IDs. If schools do re-use SIS IDs or have duplicate accounts for users, this can add to the sync conversion delay. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAPPLICATION REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe best practice for our application partners is to use the Clever ID for account creation. However, if you’re unable to match\nthe Clever ID for account creation (you use another field), we need to know what your requirements are when our districts go\nthrough a sync or SIS ID conversion.\n\n * If you're not using the Clever ID for account creation, what fields are you using to create these accounts?\n * Do you require a crosswalk file (a file that matches up the old data to the updated)? \n * Is there any additional support or information you need during the conversion process? \n\nPlease reach out to Clever Support if you need any of this additional support. If you don’t require a crosswalk file or additional\nsupport, there is no need to reach out.\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWHAT FIELDS ARE REQUIRED BY CLEVER? \n\n * For school data:\n   * School_id\n   * School_number\n   * School_name\n * For student data:\n   * School_id\n   * Student_id\n   * First_name\n   * Last_name\n * For teacher data\n   * School_id\n   * Teacher_id\n   * First_name\n   * Last_name\n * For section data\n   * School_id\n   * Section_id\n   * Teacher_id (Unique identifier of primary teacher for section, must match a Teacher id found in teachers.csv)\n * For enrollments data\n   * School_id (School id must match a School id provided in schools.csv upload)\n   * Section_id (Section id must match a Section id provided in sections.csv upload)\n   * Student_id (Student id must match a Student id provided in students.csv upload)\n * Contact data is not required but if the district decides to sync this data, we require the following:\n   * Contact_relationship (Contact’s relationship to student - e.g. ”Father”, ”Aunt” or ”Neighbor”)\n   * Contact_type (Type of contact - e.g. ”family”, ”emergency” or ”guardian”. If providing student contacts, then Contact type is\n     required)\n   * Contact_name \n * Staff data is not required but if the district decides to sync this data, we require the following:\n   \n   * Staff_id\n   * Staff_email\n   * First_name\n   * Last_name\n\nIf your application requires certain fields that you are not seeing as synced, please reach out to the district to make sure they\nare syncing that field to Clever.\n\nWHO HANDLES THE SYNC OR SIS ID CONVERSION?\n\n * Clever completes the conversion process while working with the schools\n    \n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to Clever Support!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Users who do not have access to your app\n4. Users who cannot log in to your app through Clever\n5. Student accounts are not correct in your app\n\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThis article will walk you through helpful tips to troubleshoot user login issues with your application – for both district and\nLibrary-enabled connections. Library-enabled teacher sign-ups are much simpler than district connections - there are no sharing\nrules to configure or overnight syncs, and teachers can make changes directly regarding which of their classes are shared, rather\nthan having to go through a district admin. However, as with any integration, there are potential things that could go wrong.\n\n\n\nUSER CLEVER LOGIN ISSUES\n\nThe first step in troubleshooting a login issue is to verify that the user can log in to Clever. To do this, follow the steps\noutlined in our Common Single-Sign On (SSO) issues article to triage the issue and identify where the issue is occurring. Login\nmethods are configured by the district, so if the user has issues logging in to Clever, we recommend directing the user to their\ndistrict support contact for further investigation.\n\n \n\nClever Tips:\n• Occasionally, school districts may hide applications in their Clever Portal, which causes users to lose access to the app. You\ncan find out more here: Clever Portal: Hiding Applications\n• School districts can pause the app sync, which could cause potential login issues (e.g., a new student’s account won’t be synced\nif on pause). You can view this status on your homepage and see more info here: For Clever Admins: Pausing your sync for a\nspecific app\n\n\n \n\n\nUSERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR APP\n\nDistrict-enabled connections\n\nFor district-enabled connections, you can identify whether a teacher or student is configured to have access to your product by\nsearching for their name in your Clever Dashboard. \n\nFirst search for the name of the district, and then search for the name of the user:\n \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLibrary-enabled connections\n\nPlease note: Since Clever does not share sensitive information with Library applications, the user search feature is only\navailable to district-enabled connections. \n\n\nIf a user has trouble logging into your Library application, they should reach out to their Clever Admin for further assistance\n(helpful articles to reference: For District Admins: Clever Library, Troubleshooting: Logging in to applications). Your app’s\nLibrary integration can also always be tested on the Integration guide page found in your dashboard, under Library + App Store >\nIntegration Guide.\n\n \n\n\nUSERS WHO CANNOT LOG IN TO YOUR APP THROUGH CLEVER\n\nIf teachers or students can click on your product’s icon, but are not logged in successfully, there is likely an issue with how\nyour product processes the login.\n\nFor district-enabled connections, to allow your team to reproduce and identify the issue, you can initiate a Clever log-in to your\napplication as a specific student or teacher by clicking the Log in as… button on the user’s profile page (accessed by searching\nfor the user by name):\n\n\n \n\nThis kicks off the same OAuth process that occurs when that user logs in via Clever, and should surface any issues that the user\nis seeing.\n\n For Library-enabled connections, verify your Library integration is working as expected by navigating to Library + App Store>\nIntegration Guide in your dashboard.\n\n\nSTUDENT ACCOUNTS ARE NOT CORRECT IN YOUR APP\n\nThis issue most commonly occurs when your product has not synced the latest information from Clever. We recommend either syncing\ndata on each teacher log-in, or adding a Sync with Clever or Import from Clever button to the page in your product where teachers\nmanage their classes, for example:\n \n\n\n\nIn your Clever Dashboard, you can navigate to the profile page for a student or teacher to see the current information that has\nbeen synced from the district’s Student Information System (SIS):\n\n\n\nIf the data in Clever for a teacher is incorrect, for example if they are missing a student, it is likely that the district’s SIS\nis not accurate. In this case, direct the teacher to check with the person at their school who manages the SIS, often referred to\nas the school secretary or the school registrar."

What districts see\n4. What applications see  \n5. How are staff shared with applications?\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nA common point of confusion in Clever is the difference between School Admins and Staff users in Clever. These are the same user\ntype in Clever but are represented with different titles depending on if you are a district or application partner.\n \n\n\n \n\nIn early 2019, we re-branded the \"School Admin\" user type to \"Staff\" for our district partners. This included updated titles in\nthe district dashboard, deprecation of our admins.csv file, and introduction of the staff.csv file.\n\n \n\n\nHOW DO DISTRICTS SYNC STAFF TO CLEVER?\n\nThe staff role is designed for users that are not connected to rosters but need access to applications, including school admins!\nBy default, all staff users are created as Portal Access only users, meaning they'll have access to the Clever Portal for Single\nSign-On (SSO) into applications just as students and teachers do. However, staff can be assigned the role of School Tech Lead\nwhich offers additional administrative capabilities.\n\nDepending on a districts sync type, there are four ways that districts can sync staff users to Clever:\n \n\n 1. Uploading staff via CSV\n 2. Sync staff with Active Directory\n 3. Using Infinite Campus API or Skyward API syncs\n 4. Custom data: staff\n\n\n\nWHAT DISTRICTS SEE\n\nThe district-facing Data Browser shows staff under a single tab titled Staff. Selecting the Staff tab will show a list of\nstaff/school admins that currently exist in Clever for the district.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\nWHAT APPLICATIONS SEE\n\nThe application-facing Data Browser shows staff/school admins under the School Admins tab.\n \n\n\n\nSelecting the School Admins tab will allow applications to apply a filter and view staff/school admins associated with your\nconnected school districts.\n \n\n\nHOW ARE STAFF SHARED WITH APPLICATIONS?\n\nStaff and school administrators can use SSO to access learning applications as administrators. Staff users abide by explicit\nsharing logic so that only staff that are intentionally shared with an application through a sharing rule will gain access to the\nprogram. This aligns with existing behavior for sharing all other data types.\n \n\nPlease note: The Staff tab on the district Dashboard and the School Admins tab on the application Dashboard reflect the same data."

Examples of common edtech search terms \n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTeachers can search for applications in the Clever Library by name and using keywords. To improve their applications'\ndiscoverability, partners can add up to 10 tags directly in the Clever Dashboard, in the Library + App Store tab > Marketing\nCollateral. \n\nAdding tags will give partners the opportunity to provide additional definitions and characteristics about their application,\nmaking it easier for teachers to find the right application for their needs. \n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHOW TO ADD TAGS TO YOUR APPLICATIONS\n\n 1. Sign into your Clever Dashboard\n 2. Go to the 'Library + App Store' tab in the left-hand menu\n 3. Go to ‘Marketing Collateral’ in the left-hand menu\n 4. Scroll down to ‘App details’ and click Edit\n 5. Create tags for your app, then save your changes\n\nThe changes will go live on your app detail page as soon as you save. To see the results on and test the new search results, you\ncan impersonate a teacher via your demo account.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTIPS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR TAGGING\n\n * To optimize search, make sure your tags are less than 24 characters each.\n * Add tags that reference specific skills (i.e. ‘addition’, ‘subtraction’) , features and capabilities (‘student-paced’,\n   ‘gamified’) , or curriculum requirements (‘experimental method’, ‘earth and space science’). These are typical search terms\n   that teachers query with.\n * Add non-Library categories as tags since the Library has 10 official categories. Do not repeat your existing categories as tags\n   because the Clever search algorithm already surfaces your app based on its category. The 10 official categories include:\n   Assessment, Authoring, Classroom Management, English, Math, Presentation, Science, Social Studies, Technology, Other.\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEXAMPLES OF COMMON EDTECH SEARCH TERMS\n\n * SEL\n * RtI\n * MTSS\n * ELL\n * Adaptive Learning\n * Reading comprehension\n * Classroom management\n * Offline access\n * Group activities\n * Game-based learning\n * Computer science\n * Puzzles\n * Design\n * SPED\n * SAT\n * PSAT\n * Bilingual\n * Standards\n * Video\n * Inclusion\n * Common core\n * Fluency\n\n\nFor more examples, click here."

How to read teacher reviews for your application\n5. How to reply to teacher reviews\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTeacher reviews and comments are extremely valuable for curriculum leaders when evaluating existing or new edtech apps to\npurchase. In addition to leaving a rating, teachers often provide helpful comments about the accessibility and usability for\ndecision makers to consider when assessing your application.  \n\nYou can help increase the number of reviews on your app detail page by asking teachers who are using your application to leave a\nreview. Once teachers leave a review, you will be able to read and reply to the review in your dashboard. Reviews and any replies\nwill also be published on your application’s public-facing profile page in the App Store.\n\n\n\nHOW TEACHERS CAN LEAVE A REVIEW FOR YOUR APPLICATION\n\nWhether you have a Secure Sync or Library integration, once you are in the Clever App Store, your application is eligible to\nreceive verified teacher reviews.\n\nA verified teacher review means that the teacher has logged into your application at least once before leaving a review.\n \n\n\n \nTeachers can leave reviews from their Clever Portal by navigating to your application via the search bar, and clicking 'Details'. \n\n\n \nIf you have a profile page in Clever Library, teachers can navigate to your Library listing's URL where they'll be able to leave a\nreview (if they have already installed and used your application). This is useful if you want to direct teachers to a specific\npage where they can leave a review.\n\nPlease note: You can identify teachers who installed your application in the Clever Library via your API.\n\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR REQUESTING REVIEWS FROM TEACHERS\n\nIf your application doesn't have reviews, we encourage you to reach out to teachers directly to as for them to leave a review and\ncomments in Clever. Use this sample messaging to ask teachers who have used your app to leave a review.\n\nClever is also proactively prompting teachers to leave reviews for the applications they use when they log into their Clever\nPortal.\n * Use value-based messaging when asking for reviews. When sending emails asking for reviews, include some tips, ideas, or\n   guidance on how to get the most out of using your application. View sample messaging here.\n * Optimize the timing of when you ask teachers for reviews. Consider timing your ask around when the teacher has used your\n   product independently or with students, within a certain number of days after logging into your application, or during a time\n   when they're likely to engage with your product.\n * Send one review request per teacher. If a teacher doesn't respond to your request for a review, don't send them a second\n   request.\n\n\nGUIDELINES\n\n * Be open to all types of feedback. Teachers trust the feedback of other teachers, so having a range of reviews on your\n   application gives you an opportunity to establish trust and authenticity with your users, in addition to receiving valuable\n   product feedback.\n * Per FTC guidelines , don't offer money or prizes in exchange for reviews. If you offer an incentive for teachers to leave\n   reviews, you must instruct the reviewer to indicate that this was an incentivized endorsement.\n\nClever is excited to be a trustworthy source of teacher reviews. With this in mind, we reserve the right to flag any unusual\nreview behavior.\n\n\n\nHOW TO READ TEACHER REVIEWS FOR YOUR APPLICATION\n\nYou can view all teacher reviews in your Clever Dashboard. Navigate to the Library + App Store tab, where you will see all your\nreviews listed. Depending on your integration(s), either Secure Sync or Library, you'll be able to see which version the reviewer\nis accessing next to their name.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT REVIEWS\n\n * Reviews will be sorted based on the date they were submitted.\n * You do not have the ability to delete reviews.\n * However, you do have the ability to reply to reviews. Reviews will be shared publicly on your profile page. Continue reading\n   below for guidance on how to reply to teacher reviews.\n\n\nHOW TO REPLY TO TEACHER REVIEWS\n\nApplications can reply to each individual review directly in their dashboard by clicking on the 'Respond' button next to the\nreview.\n \n\n\nTeachers will see a notification in their Clever Portal that their review has a response.\n\n\n\n\nYour response will be visible to all visitors on your Application Detail Page.\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving your response, you can return to your dashboard any time to edit or delete your response."

Updating marketing collateral\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nClever's App Store is where districts can explore and discover their favorite Edtech products to install. In addition, Clever\nprovides districts with rich data and insights to help them make informed purchase decisions and receive continual updates about\neach application.\n\nAn application's profile, which is displayed in the Clever App Store, is how district decision-makers learn about the benefits of\neach application. Your unique application profile details can provide the information to help district curriculum leaders and\nadministrators better understand what makes your product unique and valuable when they are evaluating and shopping for learning\napplications in the Clever App Store. The more robust your profile page is, the more likely shoppers (i.e., district admins) will\ngenerate instant quotes, submit purchase requests, or purchase your application directly in the App store.\n\n\nYour application's profile page can be updated from the Marketing Collateral tab in your Clever Dashboard.\n\n\n\nHOW YOUR APP IS SHOWCASED\n\nWhen an administrator searches for your application in Clever's App Store, they will be directed to your app's profile page.\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION APPEARS ON YOUR APP PROFILE:\n\n * Basic information about your application (Name, tagline, description)\n * Details about your application (categories, grade levels, standards alignment, tags, device, and platform compatibility,\n   pricing, case students, and links to your website)\n * Artwork to show what your application looks like (app icon, banner, screenshots, and video walkthroughs)\n\n\n\n\n\nCLEVER DATA ON YOUR APP PROFILE PAGE\n\nTo support a data-rich shopping experience, Clever surfaces the following sources of data and insights on your app's profile page:\n\n * Verified teacher reviews: This includes a 5-star rating for how engaging, educational and easy-to-use your application is, as\n   well as comments. \n * Teacher purchase requests: This shows shoppers an aggregate number of teachers that have requested to purchase your application\n   if it's available to them in their Clever Portal.\n * Teacher usage: This gives shoppers a sense of how popular your application is within Clever. This will appear as:\n   * District-specific teacher usage: This aggregates the number of teachers that have installed your app via Clever Library (if\n     you have that integration), and teachers who have linked to your application's website in their Clever Portal.\n   * Usage across Clever districts: This aggregates the total number of teachers across Clever that log into your application from\n     their Clever Portal.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATING MARKETING COLLATERAL\n\nYou can update what appears on your app's profile page by adding content under the Marketing Collateral tab in your Clever\nDashboard. Every application partner in the App Store starts with a basic profile consisting of their application name and icon.\n\nFollow these instructions to update your profile with screenshots, description, and other information:\n * Log in to Clever at https://apps.clever.com/\n * Navigate to Library + App Store > Marketing Collateral in the left-hand navigation menu\n\nThere, you can add the following:\n\n\nBASIC INFORMATION\n\n * App name: the name of your product\n * Tagline: A short description (maximum 60 characters)\n * Long description: A full description of your application's capabilities and features (maximum 1,000 characters)\n\n\nAPP DETAILS\n\n * Subject and categories: Choose from a list of subjects or categories your application should be listed under\n * Grade levels: Select all grade levels your product supports\n * Standards alignment: Link to web pages that outline standards alignments for your application\n * Tags: Add up to 10 tags to help your application better appear in search (learn more about tags)\n * Device and platform compatibility: Select which platforms and operating systems your product supports\n * Pricing: Your application's pricing model (Freemium, Free trial, Free, Paid)\n * Research and case studies: Link to web pages that host research, case studies, or relevant content\n * Data privacy and security: Link to your website, terms of service, and privacy policy\n\n\nPRICING\n\nYou can also add price ranges to your app profile page.

Tips for making your self-guided demo great\n\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWhen this feature is enabled for your product, edtech buyers in the App Store can instantly try a self-guided demo of your\nproduct. A self-guided demo uses Clever’s single sign-on (SSO) technology to give buyers instant access to a demo teacher and demo\nstudent’s account in your product.  There’s no cost to our partners for participating in this feature.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHow it works:\n\n * When a user selects either a Teacher or Student user type to demo, then clicks Launch demo, the user can view a teacher or\n   student account in a fake district called App Store Demo District.\n * This allows users to see the logged-in experience of your product, without having to set up a trial or demo account\n * Since they’ll only be able to explore your product while they’re in the Clever App Store and they’re impersonating a demo\n   account, this can’t be used as a backdoor to free access\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSETTING UP A SELF-GUIDED DEMO\n\nHere are the setup steps:\n\nStep 1: Email app-store@clever.com to notify us that you’d like to set up self-guided demos. Partners who go live in the App Store\nafter 9/1/2021 can skip this step.\n\nStep 2: Our team will connect your product with App Store Demo District via Secure Sync, and specifically make sure App Store Demo\nElementary data is shared with your app \n\nStep 3: Your team then needs to sync with this district then provision premium accounts for the students and teachers shared from\nApp Store Demo District.\n\nPlease Note: These accounts should have the level of access you would provide to a school or district so that buyers can\nexperience the correct version \n \n\nStep 4: Email app-store@clever.com when steps 3 and 4 are complete. Our team will test this feature then turn it on for your app’s\nApp Store detail page\n\n \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAKING YOUR SELF-GUIDED DEMO GREAT\n\nOnce the self-guided demo is set up, it will show a new user’s view of your app. To make sure the demo shows off the most\nimportant features of your app, follow these steps:\n \n\n\nTIP #1: POPULATE THE TEACHER DEMO ACCOUNT \n\nYou can directly log into the demo teacher and demo student accounts in App Store Demo District to alter the content within the\naccount, or use your Clever Dashboard tools to View Portal As these users:\n\n * Teacher name:  DEMO-Arden Perry\n * Student name: DEMO-Alberto\n\nTo give buyers the best experience, we recommend populating this demo account with sample lessons, student data, or whatever makes\nsense for your product!\n \n\n\nTIP #2: ACTIVATE THE DEMO STUDENT (DEMO-ALBERTO) \n\nLog into DEMO-Alberto’s account to see what App Store users will see when demoing the student experience. Take actions as the\nstudent user, or make changes in the DEMO-Arden Perry account that will surface in DEMO-Alberto’s account."
